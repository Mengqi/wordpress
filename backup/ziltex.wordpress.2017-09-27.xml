		<title>The First Interview</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg Financial Software Engineer intern position, failed the phone interview. Shouldn't be, but still reasonable. The interviewer probably didn't know what I'm talking about. And from the very beginning, he was more anxious than me.

First question, 1 million numbers ranged from 1 to 100,0000. Find the number that appears most. Linear programming, pretty easy one.

Second question, 10 million numbers ranged from 1 to 2^32. Find the number that appears most. Well,Â  I should have answered sort the input and then do the counting.

But I just thought using binary search tree is a better option, so long as there are a fixed number of different integers in the input string. In that case, searching the nodes representing that integer will take constant time.

However, you couldn't express it clear enough. At least you were not sure if it is a red-black tree or a binary search tree. You were not sure what you were talking about. And the interviewer thought you were some sort of blabbing.

Third question, how to do auto-correct spelling errors like "New YYork" to "New York", given a list of valid city names.

My answer was using dynamic programming to find the Longest Common Substring of the two strings. Then remove the LCS from both strings and find the LCS again. Repeat 4 times (4 is an arbitrary number here). Then use the "sum of length of all LCSs * 2 / sum of the length of the two strings" -- the "matching percentage" to measure how well the two string math.

I couldn't express it very clearly in such a short time, and he didn't know what I was talking about.

At last, "Why Bloomberg?" I just told him I was not that into engineering stuff and wanted to do math modeling and finance. This is an engineering position, dude. Saying this means you don't fit. How could anyone hire you if you told them you don't love the job? I really don't hate that, but you really should avoid talking about this.

In the interview, he kept telling me that I should follow my interest. Kind of weird, rejecting me for not dragging me into hell? I bet not, or maybe?

What's the moral of the story?
<ul>
	<li>Pay attention to the detail. As an engineering major, paying attention to detail is very important. As to talking, you should explain your idea carefully and especially detail.</li>
	<li>Speak less, but clear. You are a foreigner and you can't express your idea that clear to others. So speak less, but make sure your audience understand what you are talking about.</li>
	<li>Don't play the fancies things. This is really ironic, your resume says "full of common sense" and "good communication skills". Showing how smart you are by playing the fancy things is not a good idea. If there's an appropriate but not fancy solution, use it.</li>
	<li>Act like a man, not a boy. You speak too fast and you don't care what your audience think about. How could you become entrepreneur with such a talking style?</li>
	<li>Be more mature. You don't like Google and Microsoft? Really? No? But why you said that to the interviewer? That shows you are so arrogant and can't be a good team member, especially in an engineering team.</li>
	<li>It's OK to be quite for some time in a interview. Think carefully about the question and stop talking all the time! Generalize your solution then tell your interviewer about it.</li>
</ul>
To sum up, don't act like a nerd.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your beloved Uncle Wilfred has died at the ripe age of 98. During his lifetime, he attended Youngblood Academy, served in the navy, married Aunt Sylvie, had three children--Ella, Peter, and David--and taught high school science. How and how much of this information would you convey to the following audiences.

1. An obituary in the local paper?

Wilfred Zong, former navy commander and a dedicated high school teacher, died Monday at the age of 98.

Mr. Zong died at his home in San Bruno, California, said his life long companion and wife, Sylvie Zong.

Mr. Zong fulfilledÂ his responsibility as a US citizen: He served for his country as a Navy commander when his country needs him; he fedÂ services back to his community in San Bruno as a dedicated high school science teacher.

Wilfred Zong was born in 1948, Baoding City, Hebei, China. At the age of 5, ZongÂ and his family moved to California, United States. In his early years, Zong attended Youngblood Academy for science study. After graduated from Youngblood Academy, Zong joined the US Navy at 1965 during the Vietnam War.

After the war, Zong returned home andÂ continued his educationÂ by attendingÂ UC Berkeley to studyÂ Physics. After graduated from UC Berkeley, Mr. Zong became a teacher at San Bruno High School, where he taught science for 37 years. Zong is widely loved by his fellow students, and he got a nickname "Sir Newton" for his excellent Â teaching.

Zong married Sylvie, his life long companion at 1977. They had three children Ella, Peter, and David. The Zong family is dedicated to serving their community. They had helped providing financial supports to neighboring children to attend college.

Through his life, Wilfred Zong witnessed the drasticÂ change of ourÂ century. Mr. Zong lived his life as a true citizen, as one of the heroes of our day.

his faithful cousin,
Mengqi Zong]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Site construction is much smooth than I expected. I finished the major structure of the site at 3 a.m. Dec. 28th -- 3 days ahead of my schedule. As to the rest of it, let it be a long-term project, and this is the only efficient way to do it. After 15 hours no eating, I decided to go out to get some food.

So most of the fast food restaurants in New York are not 24-7. And trying to buy some fried chicken at 4 a.m. is really not a good idea: closed, closed, closed, closed. Fair enough, if there is no profit, who will do that? That reminds me of the United States Postal Service and the long debates about state-owned enterprise.

Finally, I got some food from a old Mexican woman's food truck at 125 St. 5 o' clock in the morning, everything on the street is still dim, and there is only cold winds blowing the overnight trashes away. This make me wondering why this old woman get up so early. If there is no profit, who will do that? Well, then it should be worthy for her to get up such early in the morning -- I would rather say it is the mid-night. Right, it should be.

Or is it? Is it worthy for at most 20 dollars profits, for a 60 years old woman? And where is your son, old lady?

So, this is life. Maybe she deserve it, or maybe not. I hope this never happens to my parents. Well, can you and will you, in the future? And how could you know if that's not happening right now? A joker on the dark corner of your heart just keeps tormenting you. And those satirizing jokes just look so real.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past few days, I have been playing World of Warcraft, the TBC version, on a private server called lastwow.

In general, this server is the best PVP private server I have ever seen (that's why I choose it). And this Euro server is quite different Â from the old server I use to play, more trolling and less goal-oriented. Also, due to people come from different time zones, you can always find players playing at any time. It's kind of interesting to play here.

Leveling up is a bit of pain to me, everything is just a boring repeat to me. However, thanks to the 15 X experience, it only takes 2 days to get to level 70.

Here comes the urban life, endless battlegrounds and endless raids. I spent 14 euro to get two top weapons:Â Hand of the Deceiver and Crux of the Apocalypse. Well, Neilyo 15 is so memorable to me. Â And that's one big reason for me to get back to WoW.

As to the rest of my gears, I tried raiding, but every raid is just one epic fail. Reminds me the time we direct Illidan (due to bugs, you can directly fight Illidan without kill all previous bosses) and watching Illidan get pwned by Akama. At last, I end up getting my every gear from battleground rewards.

Speaking of bg, there are Â a lot of noobs here whoÂ literallyÂ knows nothing about how to play bg. For example, in Arathi Basin, no one is playing defense and everyone is justÂ gatheredÂ up zerging. Kind of fine, but if you are eager about wining the bg and get the gears, then it is reallyÂ annoying. Â Later, I just got used to it and begin to enjoy it, just imagine yourself as a ruthless trouble-maker, pillaging here and there. That's kind of cool. However, when you played it too much, it just got boring. That's inevitable for almost everything.

As to the arenas, lots of good PVP players here. Since I have trouble on getting gears, arena is not that enjoyable to me at most of the times. Well, sometimes it is very funny since with my own gear, I am still able to kill players who have top gears. That's really beautiful.

In total, for the BC version, some are good and some are not. BC time is not as fantastic as I thought since there's less abilities for you to use. Well, good days just stay in the past, and trying to get it back is not a good idea. Better just leave it in your memory.

Well, one good thing about playing at lastwow is that it let me know about ArcEmu, an open source WoW server. I think I will try it later, establishing my own WoW server and also Â trying to learn something about MySQL (I always fancy about that). That's really awesome.

At last, I have to admit that it's bad for my winter break studyingÂ schedule. Now I just finished finished reading lshort. I have to change my old schedule to fit my current situation.

However, I didn't regret about this. If things come natrually, better not resist it, resist your temptation -- it can only become stronger inside you, causing much trouble later. Instead, just embrace it, and everything will be fine later on.

All right, I think that's it. I am mostly bored at the WoW and try to get back on my normal life. Time to learn some Inroduction to Computational Learning Theory.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Having been writing down some notes and questions for half a month, I find that totally worth it.

I always have trouble on thinking in depth, because it's quite easy for me get lost in thoughts and then totally can't find the way back. I guess that's one of the reasons why I only have random ideas but never made them structural.

I trust my instinct. Why I trust it? Because most of the time it used to be one of those thoughts lurking in my mind. I already draw some conclusions about it. I just can't remember it, and those conclusions just may not right... Now, with these notes, I can make it way further forÂ  correcting those false conclusions I made before and make more precise, in depth conclusions. This is really amazing and I am totally shocked.

A few days ago, I made some false interpretation about the PAC learning model based on experience. And I thought it was some pretty good one. However, later, I found those interpretation does not sound that right but I didn't know why. If I were thinking those thing only with my mind, I would probably
<ul>
	<li>lost my mind on "what if this ... Wait, what about...Â  Damn, where am I?" or "got to go to eat ... burp, burp... Wait, what is the question I have been thinking about" or ..., ..., arr... damn it...</li>
	<li>have a totally headache;</li>
	<li>get totally frustrated and think this problem is too complicated to handle;</li>
</ul>
But now, everything is different. With the notes I made, I can continue my thought easily and make  more precise interpretations. In this process, I almost lost my thoughts  like ten times. But that's OK, I can easily get back on! This is really awesome!

And one of wowcrendor's comments on how did he make those funny videos is  exactly what I want to say right now, now I rephrase it:" I scribe,  that's very important.Â  I write my idea down and keep thinking about  it. Finally I will get some really awesome ideas."]]></content:encoded>

Billy: What's a melee?

When I hesitate to ask stupid questions, this scene always comes to my mind.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do I speak in circles?

In a way, I guess. To most of the things and concepts, I never truly master their essence. I may express my partially right (i.e. great potential to have lots of mistakes) ideas by examples, but examples can never express ideas accurately.

What does the confidence level mean? I showed my concern about whether the sample can represent the population. Then I just gave an example "a bad sample can't predict the estimator correctly".

So what does that mean? It just means result from some samples may not work. Then? But in high perspective, when doing large amount of experiments, the particular amount of results proportional to confidence level will work.

My answer surely looks like a circling non-sense. What does it indicate? It indicate that you surely did not grasp the core part. It just like those bureaucratic clichÃ©s: yes, they are right; but yes, they make no sense.

Also, think before you talk. That's way better.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What is the really good thing about writing down your thoughts?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In software engineering, component reuse will bring a huge improvement on performance and efficiency. That's because people won't have to deal with trivial things like coding quick sort all the time. And remember that writing codes like quick sort one thousand times will not ever improve your skill greatly (This is not Skyrim! And shame on you, Skyrim game designers!). Actually that's why scientist build the computer, they don't have to spend endless time to calculate those equations to get some answer they already know they can get.

I find one thing about Donald Knuth is quite wise: he wrote some basic generic codes and then use them through his entire life. As to me, I can always myself in a situation of wasting time recoding basic algorithms. That's surely not a good experience. If I can build my personal repository, I probably could save 5 years in my life!

And what does all those related to writing down your thoughts? Writing thoughts down means you are actually building your personal thought repository. It's not some kind of show off (remember, NOBODY CARES!). It's about help yourself thinking.

Why can I think further with notes? Because I don't have to waste time thinking those basic ideas like quick sort in coding! And one important thing in thinking is that you can not concentrate that long. If you spend much of your time span thinking something you already know but you can't remember, then you will soon get distracted before you can think some new.

I think this is another way to explain why it is very important to write things down.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I do know things will go pretty bad, but I would never know that I could feel such disappointed about myself. Well, I know, everything will eventually turn out to be OK and I will be fine. Right, it's just a matter of time.

But now, you are humiliating yourself and you know it. Going to the office hours and the professor thought you might have missed some of the lectures when you asked him questions. Well, it's better to let others know you are a idiot and then no longer be a idiot than always be a idiot. I just kept telling myself about this.

Hey, that's not true! You can learn it by yourself, loser! You are just making excuses, work harder, baddie!

Yeah, I might should have done that. Oh, that also looks totally cool: really low keep, the mysterious man, the mysterious and powerful man. Everybody likes it, and I like it, too. You know what? I used to be one.

Right, that's absolutely cool.Â  You looks well-behaved, no dumb questions, no harsh feelings. You are the tip-top. You don't always shatter others' self-esteem, but when you do, you do it like a boss. That feels awesome.

But, eight years' silence doesn't teach me how to properly treat people. Staying quietly in the classroom not asking any questions does not make me understand what the teacher is trying to say. The no-one-know claim you are trying to crack after class probably has already been proved by some mid-20 century Russian mathematicians: you are going to have a harsh time on it and you don't know it. When you solve it, you would not be able to publish a paper. And on the other hand, you could have learnt this idea in 10 minutes by reading some papers. Yes, your effort is meaningless.

You could do it better and you know it. You know you need to communicate. "Well, that might cost me a lot," you just think those things in that way. So yo hesitate, shivering in the shadow of the good-looking past. Let the line haunts wildly in your subconscious: where is your pride?

You are the jester and you know how it feels - pride is the last thing you want to give up.

All right, then why taking a statistic course you cannot handle and looking like a completely idiot in the classroom? You probably can't get a A. Hey, you are stupid! Yeah, I am talking to you, loser!

But you know this is the best way to understand the essence of computer science. If you haven't taken it, you probably can't truly understand those NLP models; and you never will be able to appreciate the beauty of Occam's Razor.

<a href="http://xkcd.com/33/"><img class="alignleft" title="If I am not brave, will I post it? Maybe I am just stupid. And maybe this should be called rash." src="../wp-content/uploads/2012/02/yong.jpg" alt="" width="145" height="443" /></a>Now, you look even more immature than what you used to be when you were 14. Asking stupid geeky questions, sending nonsense emails, spreading funny pictures to all your friends. Nobody cares doesn't mean nobody hates it, OK? You are squeezing humour form yourself!Â  Want some joke? How about "your life"?

It's hard to be a geek. And it's hard to become childish. Thinking more and more rationally isn't that cool as you thought about. You can feel your mind is solidifying: your world is falling apart. Connections are being destroyed. And everything there is just white and grey. At last, you know exactly that few people will appreciate what you have done. It simply takes so much efforts to make up your mind -- to give up things that are shiny, to say goodbye to all your friends, to embrace the endless hard working hours. You are going to be alone on the road ahead.

You used to be never begging people for help. Because that's the price you can't take. And you would rather give yourself a harsh time than asking people for help. But why are you doing it right now? Just look at you, you changed.

Actually, I never changed. I am still the one I use to be. I am still learning things in the harsh way, in a much much more harsh way. I still cherish my dignity, but can only afford the most precious part. Becoming a monkey in the suit some day is just so scary.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Lesson of Life</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I always thought that love is just for cowards. And I am probably right. Because all those people I have ever seen who rushed into the river of love were just bored of their personal pursuit and only wanted to have some fun. If you can have some fun, then why not?

But love is not everything, that's for sure. One day you will get bored of it, just like all other things. I used to think that if I am strong enough, I can live my own life without company. Actually I still think so. I know what I want: the self-perfection and the ultimate answer to everything. And that's almost nothing about love. Newton didn't get married for his entire life, but still did lots of excellent work. Solitude maybe one important reason for his success -- he has more time than anyone else to do what he wants, with his free will.

All in all, at least I don't want to be a coward. Attempting to pursue a relationship because I am bored and afraid of the road ahead? That's ridiculous and extremely humiliating to a man with a brave heart. Everyone has to accept the challenge life bestowed him in order to achieve his own goal. That's how this world works. The harder the battle, the sweeter the victory.

Well, maybe you are just that selfish. You thought all the girls you have met are just blood suckers who want to bleed you dry. And they came to you simply because they saw your success. Well, I am not that good. But probably, most of the girls I have ever seen are just afraid of dying alone and want some easy money. I bet they never know what love is all about.

"Some sort of cool thing to brag about and to post on the social networks?" They probably think so.

Come on people, I feel totally bored talking with you. And I really don't want to get stuck with a loser for my entire life and keep feeding her my money. And having suffered my entire day at work, I still have to face your angry face and spend some time to calm you down? I don't want to waste my precious time and emotions on you. I always get things to do and I am really busy.

Am I wrong? Actually, most of them are douchebags and blood suckers. Gee, when I was chilling out and minding my own business before I won my respect from my college, you guys are so arrogant. Now, you just turn out to be this humble with no reason? What's wrong with your twisted souls, people? Yeah, I know personal success can change one's opinion, but there's no contradiction with that you guys are assholes.

Well, I am really not a believer of love. My parents' marriage seems to be such a pain. And that's purely their own choice! Fact is both of them are not happy for a long time. Still, I am glad I finally relived the situation a little by my small success. That gives them honour and hope. But before that, all I heard are "look at <strong>your</strong> son, bla bla bla...". It's a situation you definitely want to avoid -- even your parents want to shit in your face. Home may look sweet, but I never really enjoyed staying there.

Well, I give my respect to my parents for building up their everything all by themselves. They are generally good people with kind hearts. And it's them who gave me all their life savings to help me pursue my dream. And they did treat me well, though not always. And I was not always a good son. But Mao Zedong is also not a good son. But no one is born to be a good parent. At last, I know that I have to go away, just like what's in the song of Cat Stevens. I just want my freedom. And please everyone, just leave me alone.

Coming to the States, I finally got a chance to be absolutely alone. All my old friends are 6000 miles away. Here, no one knows me and no one cares. I thought I could finally truly enjoy what I have been dreaming of, doing whatever I want without being disturbed.

But things always turned out to be far away from what I thought them to be. I then realised that I am still a social animal -- I could act awesome while standing in the corner a distance away from the crowd, but can't stay cool without the crowd. I spent so much time checking and rechecking the websites and emails. And it was boring and I knew it.

"You are not tough enough", that's what came to my mind. But life is not like sports, you just need to stick to something and the goal is that simple. On the contrary, it's complicated. And inspirations from regression model and the famous game "the Sims" tell me that you can only achieve a great achievement when you are happy -- Ironically, a mental status most people are pursuing for.

Wait, I like what I am doing now. Yes, the burden it's a little bit heavy, but still OK to me. Then what happened to me? Why do I feel so anxious, depressed?

I was lost at that time, trying to find the answer. Until later I learned it from a girl.

"The joy found in solitude, freedom, independence, and even inner spiritual power, is different from the joy stemmed from human bonding, healthy relationship, having a loving family. Both are important, but one cannot substitute for another." That's what she said. A lesson no one ever succeed teaching me through.

This is why I am trying to start a relationship with her. Though I am still totally messed with this crazy semester; though waiting and guessing made me can't study at all for days; though self-esteem almost drove me into smashing everything for several times because of the humiliations I never undertook before.

It's a challenge, not an escape. And it will benefit you in the long run, though in the short run you are going to suffer. It's a road to learn, not simply for the result. The result doesn't matter that much. Actually all results never matter that much. Just embrace life itself and see what it is going to show you.

Welcome to the river of love.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>From Computational Power to Intelligence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Professor Alexander told me that IBM is doing a long term project aiming at building a cluster as complicated as human brain. This cluster will have as many CPUs as the number of neurons in a human brain.

Well, no one knows what is going to happen when we have such a powerful computer. Maybe all those exponential-time AI algorithms which have been considered useless will turn out to be quite practical. It is just because currently we don't have such a powerful machine. And if we have a machine as powerful as a human brain, then computer can do what human can do. Zing, intelligence!

Actually, I am really not a big fan of this. I always think that there are some philosophical ideas which play a crucial role on intelligence still have not yet been discovered. At least, all state-of-the-art AI algorithms does not look like what our brain works. And how could we assume that we can invent intelligence with such a powerful machine while not knowing how to rule it? Miracle? Not that likely to me.

And this can't explain the irrationality rooted in our way of thinking.Â  As human beings, we are not always rational. And who said irrational is a bad thing? Rational is just conventional wisdom. If everyone thinks the world is flat, then thinking world as a round object will be the so-called irrational. Right, the proof of earth as round does require careful observation and accurate reasoning. But I always believe, we get the idea, or that flash, from a sudden irrational thought. A thought breaks the bound of thinking.

Our intelligence is naturally nondeterministic.

I always believe that randomness is closely related to what this world is all about. Personal experience tells me that certainty is not what this world means to be. This even contradicts with the meaning of life -- If your life is certain and you can do nothing about it, then why live?

To me, uncertainty is the meaning of life. Because if life is uncertain, and you know nothing about what is going to happen next, then your life begins making sense. And this uncertainty is not totally out of our control -- we still can choose the main direction. So it is a semi-controllable uncertainty. What is this thing? Probability.

You can set your minds to increase your probability to particular things, but it's hardly can be certain, i.e. a probability of 100%. It's almost like what this world is all about. Think about the idea of regression. Or just think about its origin -- Evolutionism. As a sample unit, you can do whatever you want, but to everything you do, there is a probability. If there is a God, then God just wants to control the mean and the variance of the normal distribution. That is, the mean is what he wants. Too extreme will cause trouble to single sample unit. But if everyone's behaviour changes, that is, mean changes. Then it is a different story. In this way, human evolves. World progresses in a certain but not too certain direction.

This reminds me about quantum computing. The key difference between the normal computing and quantum computing is that quantum computing is naturally random. If you have dealt with randomness on current computers, you will know that real randomness does not exist in current computers. And it's really clumsy to represent randomness and probability on them. But on a quantum computer, it is just that natural.

And that's one reason why quantum computing is this powerful. When dealing with a really complicated problem, using one computer to crack it will be really time consuming. Then why not use lots of computers and let every one guess it? And if the "lots of" is one, then better!

The idea of quantum computing really makes me rethink about what has been described in "The hitch-hikers' guide to the galaxy" -- Earth is a super computer and every human being is a sample unit of the computer. And every human is running a nondeterministic algorithm to compute the ultimate answer to life, universe and everything. Exactly what a quantum computer do.

Why nondeterministic algorithm? Why not a deterministic one?

Because deterministic algorithm is too slow. And if you have a large sample, then with each sample unit runs nondeterministic algorithm will turn out to be much faster.

But only one thing, it seems to be really hard to implement recursion on this model of world. Because human beings have a certain life span. This makes progress slower than it should be.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In order to implement "memorylessness", you need to have a memory.

What is memoryless? Current procedure's probability only depends on the current procedure. Why it is called memoryless? Because every time you do this procedure, it seems like the very first one. That is, there's nothing before that (actually, there are things before that). So, you are acting like a guy without memory (can't remember anything ever happened to you).

However, if you don't have a memory, then once you failed, you have to restart over from the very beginning. In this case, the probability not only depends on the current procedure, but also depends on the previous ones. Then it is not memoryless.

On the other hand, if you have a memory, you can act like you are "memoryless". Because every time you fail, you just need to check up your memory and restore the situation one step before the procedure ever happened. In this case, you are truly memoryless!"

That is, by restoring the previous situation using a memory, the probability of the current procedure only depends on the current procedure. And it seems to be the only way for sequential events to be memoryless (I am kind of assuming that "cause and effect" are everywhere).]]></content:encoded>

That saved a wretch like 		me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.</blockquote>
<blockquote>T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears 		relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear

Bright shining as the 		sun.

I could not believe that I am reading this on a Christian-style funeral. This poem fits lots of situations. And I can find its religious origin everywhere in this poem.

On the front-line of Internet the war between atheists and Christians is severe that ever. However, as a atheist, I respect the amazing religious art works.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. -- Homer Simpson</blockquote>
This is probably the easiest and most obvious lesson in the world: never try. Especially never try to guess one's thought, because you probably will fail miserably. Still, tons of people out there think they are smart enough to handle it. No, they can't handle it. And yes, I can't do that, too.

The chance of you making a wrong prediction is so damn high. The reason for this is rooted in the reason why you want to guess it. Think about it. If you know some people well enough, will you bother yourself guessing what they are thinking?

No, you don't have to. And nobody would have to. This is because you know them so long that you can know what they are thinking without even guessing. You guys have been hanging over for so many years.

Then when do you desperately want to guess what's on your friends' minds? The time when you don't know them well. You are eager to know what type of people are they since you just meet each other for only a few days. Watch out, this means that you don't have enough past events to make an accurate enough prediction! You probably gonna to mess it up.

Simple is the perfect mind condition for almost every situation. Generosity is the most suitable attitude when you want something from others.

The lesson is, never try. Never try.
<blockquote>Jack Green: One thing I've learned in the last seven years: in every game and con  there's always an opponent, and there's always a victim. The trick is to  know when you're the latter, so you can become the former. -- "Revolver"</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Conversation in a Simple Way</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rule of Thumb: On 95% of the cases, express your idea briefly and easy-to-understand.

1. How to express your idea briefly?

On 68.3% of the cases, your email/text message/talk should be NO more than 70 words, or NO more than 1 paragraph.

On 95.4% of the cases, your email/text message/talk should be NO more than 140 words, or NO more than 2 paragraphs.

2. How to express your idea easy-to-understand?

On 95% of the cases, your email/text message/talk should make sense to 95% of your audience. You should avoid using terms, philosophical ideas,Â  unpopular topics, and educational tones (This can irritate your audience in a causal conversation).

3. How could I know it is the situation in the 5%?

If it is possible for you to express your idea briefly and easy-to-understand, then do it. Beat the long, boring and hard-to-understand expression as possible as you can.

If you can't express your idea such intuitively, then you should try remaining silent at the first place. If that is not an appropriate action, then you may want to try a long, complicated expression. This kind of situation is rarer than you think.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[0. Simple is good.

1. In causal conversations, nobody wants to be really serious, at least at the very beginning. So beat the serious topics.

2. Telling the truth is not always the best action. Because:
<ul>
	<li>Nobody cares about your truth.</li>
	<li>Nobody wants to hear about the truth even if it is true.</li>
</ul>
So if you can't say some appropriate words, then don't say.

3. Don't always want to tell other people how hard your time is.

First, nobody cares.

Second, nobody wants to hear about it.

Third, everyone is busy too! It gives other people an impression that you are just a kid who never experienced anything before. And probably they are right. When you look backwards, you will realize that's nothing. See entry #2.

4. If you know nothing about other people's situation, do NOT endlessly talk about your opinion about it. Because your opinion is probably very wrong and you just look like a jerk in other people's eyes.

Why not stay humble and try to learn something from others?

5. There's always a reason for a conversation. Better knows what they need. And speak things straight to the point. This makes everyone's life easier. Aimlessly talking somethings is not always a good choice. See entry #2.

6. Your comforting words can't make people feel better about their misfortune if the words can't change the situation. Then what should you do? Don't mention it. Like what our society does. See entry #2.

7. One lesson I learned several years ago about the assumptions of your strategy: You should assume everyone is smart enough and informative enough to know exactly what you are about to do.

In other words, don't expect you can cheat people or people will make silly mistakes. To be somewhat specific, lying is what you can't handle, and it can NOT give you benefits in general.

8. Before you say something, ask yourself the following question: Does anyone care? See entry #5.

9. If you help others and others help you, all your life become easier and better. And that's why we need conversations - the simplest way of information exchange. It can satisfy both sides' needs. Since this is the general reason of a conversation, then better help others in a conversation. See entry #5.

10. Text based online chatting sometimes can be pretty messy. Due to the latency of your typing and reply, it's very easy for two people to talk about their own things. So, pay attention to the trends of what they want to talk about and cooperate. See entry #5.

11. Slow down, don't speak that fast.

12. Try to not be that self-centric in a conversation. That is, care about how other people feel.

13. Do not hide your ignorance. Be honest, and proactive when necessary. This means, if your ignorance could prevent you from understanding what others are talking about, then speak it out. Because, if not, you are wasting other person's time. This is consistent with #5. And this is different with #2, but both #2 and #13 are saving other person's time.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1. Can complicated statement show that a person is clever?

No. If there exists a simple statement, then this person is dumb. Only dumb people are good at making simple things complicated. Smart people are good at making complicated things simple.

2. Then why people always think a person who can state a complicated statement clever?

Beware of the "relativity" here. The word "simple" and "complicated" make sense only when there is a comparison.

People often compare apple with orange. Some topics are easy to explain but some are not. For those not-easy-to-explain topics, one person has to use a more sophisticated statement. In this case, it is complicated. However, note that this "complicated" statement is the simplest statement one person can offer for this not-easy-to-explain topic.

Why he or she looks clever? Because for this topic, most people don't understand! That is, most people can only make a statement for this topic with a complexity of infinity. In contrast, the one who can state a valid but complicated statement is definitely more clever than those people.

But what if some people can make a easy to understand statement? Then those people are the best.

3. So...

Some awful people always try to take advantage of the subtlety between cleverness and complexity. They will try to explain an idea to a outsider as complicated as possible to show that how clever they are. This is really ridiculous. Or I really should say this is evil.

4. What's the moral of the story?

Simple is good.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Thought and a Self-denial</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Not sure if the thing is good... But if FEW people want to try that, then it worth a try!</strong>

I am so passionate about doing those stupid things, especially when I am extremely confident and in a leading position. But there's always another voice in my mind: this contradicts the philosophy "wisdom of the crowd".

For those weird things I have tried, the good thing is, I learned an important lesson. And the bad thing is, I learned it in the hard way. Later on, I just realized that the hard way learning procedure makes me falling behind from others.

But does this means that I should stop trying new things? Absolutely not.

But if I am more knowledgeable about this new thing, then I can make a better decision. So the problem behind all things actually is: my <strong>information</strong>.

Everyone has its own constraints and limits. And everyone is weak. Recklessly trying everything will just lead to self-destruction. And it's safe to follow the conventional wisdom if you can't show it is bad.

What is conventional wisdom? Back to my college days, everyone is playing and no one wants to study. So does this means that I should have played a lot like the rest of my classmates?

No. But why did I choose to study hard at college? Is that because no one wants it? No, it is because I have a valuable information that playing a lot will definitely lead to a bad result. And that information is the conventional wisdom. If the useful information is <strong>unique</strong>, then you will make a difference.

So I should follow the normal routine if I don't have a valid reason to not to. And the more information I have, the more "correct" my routine is.

So what about now?

I clearly knows that currently my information is below the average. And I am a student. I came here to learn, to learn about everything. Time for conversations.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Don't wanna wait 'til tomorrow
Why put it off another day?
One by one, little problems
Build up and stand in our way, oh

One step ahead, one step behind it
Now ya gotta run to get even
Make future plans, I'll dream about yesterday, hey
Come on turn, turn this thing around

(Right now)
Hey! It's your tomorrow
(Right now)
Come on, it's everything
(Right now)
Catch your magic moment
Do it right here and now
It means everything</blockquote>
Just get proper treated in the exam of advanced data analysis, the statistic course.Â  CS major, why?

Why? Why not? I must face it someday, it's just a matter of time. And it better to be right now.

Move on.]]></content:encoded>

Everytime I hang out with her, it just like a task, not something enjoyable.

The talk was totally not right. I couldn't take control of it, and we were lost in the sea of oblivion.

Age, age, age. Age?

I need some time to figure this out.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now I feel gulty, like I didn't go to work for a day. I just feel like I should have done something today. But I just didn't. And I have been missing her all day long.

Now I can understand why she was so desparate about my only sending her a message once a week. If she likes me, then my action was so cruel. I was so dumb.

She is still one third of my world. 

But shouldn't things be a little bit better than now?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Na na na na na ,na na na, hey Jude...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">When you stop seeing beauty
You start growing old
The lines on your face
Are a map to your soul</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When you stop taking chances
You'll stay where you sit
You won't live any longer
But it'll feel like it</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I lost myself in the summer rain
I lost myself
I lost myself in the summer rain
In the summer rain</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tequila and Orange
Jamaica and rum
At the Moreilla
Honey on my tongue</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In a small boat on a generous sea
You let me be your enemy
Tiny hand
With a grip on the world
Holding our breath now
Diving for pearls</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I lost myself in the summer rain
I lost myself
I lost myself in the summer rain
Oh oh, oh oh</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Just as you find me
Always I will be

		<title>Benjamin Rutt&#039;s Emacs C Development Tips</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So you are developing in C (or C++, or java) in     emacs.  This web  page will hopefully make you more productive at     doing just that.  It  is based on my experience of using GNU Emacs     as a development  environment for C and syntactically similar     languages since 1997.   I'm assuming you use a relatively recent     GNU Emacs (preferably  version 21.x) on a UNIX-like machine.  Most     of my tips will probably  also work in XEmacs in some other     development environment, but your  mileage may vary.
<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
You should add any customization code to     your ~/.emacs.  If you're doing any C customization at all, add a
<pre>(require 'cc-mode)</pre>
to your ~/.emacs.  If you'd like syntax colorization, add a
<pre>(global-font-lock-mode 1)</pre>
to your ~/.emacs.
<h2>Compiling/linking your project</h2>
Emacs makes it easy to get     your project to build, by providing a  means to move the cursor     (known as the "point" in emacs) to the  locus of compilation     errors.  Simply run <tt>M-x compile</tt>, and  then type in the     name of your compilation command (this is probably  "make" or     something similar).  If there are any errors, you can  press the     key sequence <tt>C-x `</tt> to visit the first error found.  You     can then press <tt>C-x `</tt> again to visit the second error     found, etc.  To re-start the  sequence of visiting errors (i.e. to     visit the first one again), use  the key sequence <tt>C-u C-x     `</tt> which will take you back to the first error.      At one point, I got tired of typing <tt>M-x compile</tt>,  so I     bound it to a key, in particular F9 (Borland JBuilder trained  me     that this key is for building and also keys F5-F9 are      user-assignable in emacs).  Here's how I did that:
<pre>(global-set-key [(f9)] 'compile)</pre>
Now, pressing <tt>F9 ENTER</tt> starts a build.  Or, you can     adjust the build command in between pressing F9 and ENTER.
<h2>Better management of the compilation window</h2>
I don't like it that the compilation window takes up 1/2 of the      frame by default.  So, I use the following, which works well most      of the time:
<pre>(setq compilation-window-height 8)</pre>
I also don't like that the compilation window sticks around after     a  successful compile.  After all, most of the time, all I care     about  is that the compile completed cleanly.  Here's how I make     the  compilation window go away, only if there was no compilation     errors:
<pre>(setq compilation-finish-function
   (lambda (buf str)

     (if (string-match "exited abnormally" str)

         ;;there were errors
         (message "compilation errors, press C-x ` to visit")

       ;;no errors, make the compilation window go away in 0.5 seconds
       (run-at-time 0.5 nil 'delete-windows-on buf)
       (message "NO COMPILATION ERRORS!"))))</pre>
<h2>Enabling hungry delete</h2>
Simply add the    line <tt>(c-toggle-hungry-state 1)</tt> to your ~/.emacs, and you    will enable "hungry" delete, which means  that all whitespace around    the cursor will be consumed when you press  Backspace or C-d.  Try    it out, it will probably save you some  keystrokes.
<h2>Tabs vs. spaces for indentation</h2>
It's easy to  indent or    re-indent current lines when doing C development, just  press the    TAB key.  The problem comes when you want to share your  code with    others.  By default, emacs uses a mixture of tabs and  spaces for    indentation, since tabs save bytes (by representing  multiple units    of indentation with a single byte), and spaces are  important for    alignment.  Not all editors use this strategy however,  and may    barf on code that is indented using this strategy.  I  personally    like to use all-spaces for indentation and no TABs, but  sometimes    it's not your call how to indent your files.  Here's how to  play    nicely with e.g coworkers who use different editors.
<h3>If you need to use only TABs for indentation</h3>
You can    achieve this in C/C++/java modes with the following in your    ~/.emacs:
<pre>(require 'cc-mode)
(defun my-build-tab-stop-list (width)
(let ((num-tab-stops (/ 80 width))
 (counter 1)
 (ls nil))
 (while (&lt;= counter num-tab-stops)
   (setq ls (cons (* width counter) ls))
   (setq counter (1+ counter)))
 (set (make-local-variable 'tab-stop-list) (nreverse ls))))
(defun my-c-mode-common-hook ()
(setq tab-width 5) ;; change this to taste, this is what K&amp;R uses :)
(my-build-tab-stop-list tab-width)
(setq c-basic-offset tab-width))
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)</pre>
By redefining the tab-stop-list in each C (or similar) buffer     inside a hook which will be executed as each C buffer is opened,     indentations should arrive at tab stops, obviating the need for     space-padding of any kind.  This will not work correctly, however,    if  you are trying to lineup arglists, etc. (e.g. <tt>(c-set-offset    'arglist-cont-nonempty 'c-lineup-arglist)</tt>).   That's a    fundamental problem...how do you align code with TABS to  arbitrary    columns, without using spaces?  Therefore, I recommend  using only    spaces for indentation instead...
<h3>If you need to use only spaces for indentation</h3>
You can    achieve this in C/C++/java modes with the following in your    ~/.emacs:
<pre>(require 'cc-mode)
(defun my-build-tab-stop-list (width)
(let ((num-tab-stops (/ 80 width))
 (counter 1)
 (ls nil))
 (while (&lt;= counter num-tab-stops)
   (setq ls (cons (* width counter) ls))
   (setq counter (1+ counter)))
 (set (make-local-variable 'tab-stop-list) (nreverse ls))))
(defun my-c-mode-common-hook ()
(setq tab-width 5) ;; change this to taste, this is what K&amp;R uses :)
(my-build-tab-stop-list tab-width)
(setq c-basic-offset tab-width)
(setq indent-tabs-mode nil)) ;; force only spaces for indentation
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)</pre>
By adding the line with the comment "force only spaces for     indentation" to the earlier example, all indentations of new C    code  will use spaces for indentation.  This will make life easier,    as your  code will look the same in all editors and you can explore    using  spaces for lining up argument lists, etc.
<h2>Customizing indentation</h2>
First of all, put <tt>(require    'cc-mode)</tt> atop the C customization section of your ~/.emacs,    so the methods  below will be defined.  Then, while visiting a C    source file, if you  don't like how a particular line is indenting,    press <tt>C-c C-o</tt> near the expression you want to change, and    figure out the symbol to change (pressing <tt>C-c C-o</tt> gives    you a chance to set these variables interactively).  Then, do    a <tt>(c-set-offset 'symbol-to-change X)</tt> in your ~/.emacs    where X is typically a numeric value or the symbol  '+ or '-.  The    following is an example of some of my customizations,  which is    simply my personal preference:
<pre>;; personal preferences
(c-set-offset 'substatement-open 0)
(c-set-offset 'case-label '+)
(c-set-offset 'arglist-cont-nonempty '+)
(c-set-offset 'arglist-intro '+)
(c-set-offset 'topmost-intro-cont '+)</pre>
<h2>Debugging in emacs</h2>
<tt>M-x gdb</tt> (or <tt>M-x jdb</tt>)     is very useful to debug inside emacs.  Try it, it will split your     frame into two windows, with the gdb interaction buffer in the top     window and the current source line (if the program is being    executed)  displayed in the bottom window.  I typically use the    following  sequence:
<ol>
	<li>type <tt>M-x gdb</tt>.  Enter the executable name to run,      e.g. ./foobar</li>
	<li>in the gdb interaction buffer, type "break main" and "run"</li>
	<li>to use the debugger to execute the current statement and go        to the next one, use <tt>C-c C-n</tt></li>
	<li>to use the debugger to step into the current statement,      use <tt>C-c C-s</tt></li>
</ol>
You can still use all the power of gdb that you could from any     shell prompt, but the arrow following the current source line is     value added by emacs, providing debugger state without requiring a     lot of gdb <tt>list</tt> statements.
<h2>Indexing your source code for easy navigation</h2>
Emacs comes    with an <tt>etags</tt> executable (and also probably its    cousin <tt>ctags</tt>),  which can index source code, allowing you    to jump around your source  code quickly by simply giving a method    name to jump to, etc.  Here  are some simple steps to get you    started:
<ol>
	<li>from a shell, run <tt>etags *.[ch]</tt> in your source      directory, which will index or re-index the .c and  .h files in      your source directory, and will create a file named  TAGS.</li>
	<li>inside emacs, run <tt>M-x visit-tags-table RET</tt> and then      enter the name of the TAGS file created by the previous step.</li>
	<li>for example, to visit a function named "sortRecords",      type <tt>M-.</tt> and then enter the name "sortRecords".  Or,      better yet, enter just  "sortRec", as substrings will work as      well, as long as they are  unique.</li>
	<li>did your press of <tt>M-.</tt> not put you in the right      function/variable?  Then try pressing <tt>C-u M-.</tt> to visit      the next function/variable with a similar name.</li>
	<li>do you want to go back to where you were before the      last <tt>M-.</tt> or <tt>C-u M-.</tt>?  Then simply      to <tt>M-*</tt>, each press of which will pop a stack and return      you to where you came from.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pool singing at night,
And wild plum trees in tremulous white;

Robins will wear their feathery fire;
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one will care at last when it is done.
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, if mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself when she woke at dawn
Would scarcely know that we were gone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Cheers for Fallout 3.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wanderin'
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Though you might hear laughin', spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seein' that he's chasing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[That makes the difference.

With literacy, the rules are changed. And if anthropologists andÂ archaeologists still debate at what point in human history did speech become a form of communication so that the older generation could tell the younger generation all of its achievements, that its ability of hunting,Â  making of tools or implements...

That broke the barrier of time. So that each generation could start with the knowledge of the previous generation. And this occurs sometime in the distant human past.

Writing increases that power many times more. And in fact, writing is still with us, despite computer chips, technologies and Internet. It is still the same rules that Sumerians scribesÂ  created back in the Uruk period:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The caravel, developed by Iberian ship makers, combined all the advantages of the northern European round ship with all the advantages of the southern European round ship.

Because the great innovation of caravel, which, like all great innovations, seems blindingly obvious in hindsight, was to use both square sails and lateen sails on a single sailing ship.

You will have one large square sail so that you can go fast when the wind is in your back. But you will also have triangular lateen sails on board so that when the wind is against you and you need to tack into the wind, as you must do if have any hope of coming back up the coast of west Africa, well now you can do that as well. And it was the combination of different types of sails that made the caravel so uniquely useful for exploration in the fifteen century.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us.

Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.

Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'

Today a status of Leonidas holding the pass stands in his honor; in antiquity, a stone lion, marking the place where Leonidas and his Spartans had fallen, was inscribed:
<blockquote>"Go tell the Spartans, Oh stranger, that we lie here, true to the death, to our Spartan way of life."</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Even during its decline, Sparta never forgot its claims on being the "defender of Hellenism" and its Laconic wit. An anecdote has it that when Philip II sent a message to Sparta saying "If I enter Laconia, I will raze Sparta", the Spartans responded with the single, terse reply: "If."

		<title>Tacitus on Freedom</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[And in this Life of Agricola, Tacitus passes his own judgement on "this empire for which we have sacrificed so much".

"We gave up freedom in order to maintain our empire" is what Tacitus says. "We accepted the Caesar because he could keep our empire. We thought that more important. But what is our empire?"

And he allows a chieftain of the Caledonians, in a land we call Scotland today, to speak out right before the climatic battle with Agricola. Calgacus is the chieftain's name:

"The Romans are but robbers and plunderers. And their empire is nothing more than organized plunder. They come to reduce the world to slavery. If it is rich enough, an area, they will conquer it for its plunder. And if it is poor like us, they conquer it just out of the lust for power.Â  They have reduced the Gauls to slavery. They want to reduce the Germans to slavery. And now they have come to the end of the Earth, a land so alien to them, just out of their lust for power. They make a desert and they call it peace."

That is not Calgacus. That is Tacitus speaking on an empire that is corrupt and without meaning.

And then in his greatest work, his Annals, he describes the origin of this empire:

"People have been afraid", he said, "up until now, to write about the origins of this system of Augustus. I write without partisanship or anger. I simply tell you how it was. And I tell you about Augustus."

He does it without repeating the same moral judgements over and over again. He lets the deeds of Augustus speak for him. How Augustus won over the soldiers by gifts, the people with cheap bread, and everybody with the repose of peace. He set up what he called the Principate, but was in fact an imperial monarchy - ruled in hypocrisy, founded in fraud and violence. He was himself, Augustus, the arch-hypocrite.

"And we accepted his system because we were no longer worthy of freedom. We were no longer morally worthy of it. So can we be surprised when he dies we get a monster like Tiberius, a lunatic like Caligula, a fool like Claudius, or a vicious buffoon like Nero?"

"Once we step through the Tyrant's door, once we accepted its security over liberty, then our choices were gone."

- J. Rufus Fears

		<title>Florentine Bank Industry and the English Crown</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Even before the plague hit, weaknesses in the Florentine economy had been evident. In 1338, two giant banking firms, the Bardi and Peruzzi, had collapsed.

The Bardi and Peruzi were arms of wool companies, and they did Â most of their business in London, where they provided banking functions to enable their companies to buy English raw wool and ship it to Florence for manufacture into cloth. The cloth was then often re-shipped to London for sale.

Both banks had gotten into the partice of making loans to the English crown. When King Edward III became involved in the extremely expensive Hundred Years War, the status of these loans became shaky, and before long, the king defaulted. Both banks immediately collapsed.

The collapse sent shock waves through the Florentine economy and raised questions about the structure of the banking industry.

		<title>The Warrior Pope and the Church on the Eve of Reformation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Having gone through the horrors of the Babylonian Captivity and the Great Schism and having just re-conquered most of the Papal States, popes focused on ruling the church and their secular domain rather than on the task of spiritual leadership. They became immersed in Italian and European politics, were always in search of revenue, and became patrons of the arts and humanism, just like other rulers.

Pope Sixus IV (1414-1484) spent hisÂ time on re-conquering the remaining Papal States, and he put his relatives in charge of them.

Pope Alexander VI (1431-1503) used bribes to secure his election, then moved into the Vatican with his wife and seven children. While there, he had a child with his daughter Lucretia. The pope was accused of poisoning many of his opponents, and he himself died this way.

Pope Julius II (1443-1513) was known asÂ the warrior pope. Â He fought wars with major European powers such as France, Spain, Venice and other powers. The thing that is different about Julius is that he didn't fight these wars behind the scenes or from the Vatican. He got on horse, and dressed up armors, got his sword out and led the army in person... Apparently he was more of a gifted military man than he was in anything else.

Pope Clement VII and Pope Leo X, who reigned in the 1520s, were both sons of the house of Medici. They had all the political interests of the Medicis, helping the family back to power in Florence after the fall of Soderini. They were patrons of the arts and learning, true Renaissance princes. The built a new St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome and patronized Raphael and Michelangelo. Meanwhile, it was during their reigns that Martin Luther and the Reformation appeared in Germany.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #252525;">Scipio, when he looked upon the city as it was utterly perishing and in the last throes of its complete destruction, is said to have shed tears and wept openly for his enemies. After being wrapped in thought for long, and realizing that all cities, nations, and authorities must, like men, meet their doom; that this happened toÂ Ilium, once a prosperous city, to the empires ofÂ Assyria,Â Media, andÂ Persia, the greatest of their time, and toÂ MacedoniaÂ itself, the brilliance of which was so recent, either deliberately or the verses escaping him, he said:</p>

<dl style="color: #252525;"><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><em>A day will come when sacred Troy shall perish,</em>
<em>AndÂ PriamÂ and his people shall be slain.</em></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p style="color: #252525;">And whenÂ PolybiusÂ speaking with freedom to him, for he was his teacher, asked him what he meant by the words, they say that without any attempt at concealment he named his own country, for which he feared when he reflected on the fate of all things human. Polybius actually heard him and recalls it in his history.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Spanish were now ready to penetrate the heart of rebellious Holland. But the city of Alkmaar had to be attacked first so as not to leave hostile forces in the rear of the Spanish army. The city was besieged and near defeat when the Dutch breached the dikes surrounding the city, flooding the countryside and forcing the Spanish to retire. The revolt was saved for now. The Dutch have a saying "It is from Alkmaar that victory dates."

The Spanish army never made such a serious invasion into the north again, and the big rivers and dikes were a major reason.

On one occasion in 1575, when a Spanish force was besieging the town of Leiden, William of Orange ordered the dikes opened, then sailed a small fleet across what had been farmland to relieve the city.

...

Louis's armies then invaded Netherlands, and have tremendous success initially againstÂ the Dutch who don't have a particular large army.

Things are looking very bad for the Dutch. Louis captures Utrecht, he approaches Amsterdam. AndÂ he's on the verge of complete victory over the Netherlands, when the Dutch open the dikes, flood the countryside, and basically washes Louis's army away - the same way they had washed the Spanish armies away, out side of Alkmaar, and Leiden during the Dutch Revolt.

So once again, Louis's unsuccessful. he's lostÂ his second war.

These proceedings may at firstÂ appear strange and difficult; but, like all other steps which we have already passed over, will in a little time become familiar and agreeable; and, until an independence is declared, the Continent will feel itself like a man who continues putting off some unpleasant business from day to day, yet knows it must be done, hates to set about it, wishes it over, and is continually haunted by the thoughts of its necessity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What goes wrong with these emails fromÂ unknown sources?

Among a whole list of things are wrong with them, but one thing that goes wrong is that they are heavy on the Pathos, but light on Ethos.

There's nothing intrinsically ethically or morally problematic with just simple Pathos-based appeals. But as a general rule, attempts to persuade are much more successful when they combine Pathos and Ethos. And usually they are successful if they emphasize the Ethos instead of the Pathos.

You can give me the most pathetic, in the kind of classical, rhetorical sense of the word, Â the most pathetic argument ever. But if I don't trust the Ethos, it's not gonna get you very far.

I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you really want to be an astute, engaged reader and writer, then my best piece of advice would be: Be promiscuous--read everything you can; write whenever you can. You can make yourself a beautiful space in which to write. Write with a pen or a pencil, on the computer, on the back of an envelope. Read everything you can--editorials, short stories, histories, biographies, novels, poems, plays. The world around us is filled with words; take in as many as you can, and then give us some back.

		<title>Argument as a way of knowing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Argumentation is also a way of knowing. The pragmatist philosopher Charles Peirce identified four ways of knowing. Tenacity is the method of chance; one sticks to the first belief one gets. Authority involves the uncritical acceptance of a prominent person's beliefs. A priori correspondence means that beliefs are deduced from self-evident premises. Verification is the method of science.

Verification has advantages over the other three methods. It is open to public inspection. It can be replicated by others. Results are obtained by design rather than by accident. But if verification were the only acceptable path to knowledge, then we would be unable to know about some of the topics that concern us most. There would be no way to know about values, probabilities, predictions, or recommendations for action.

The alternative is to look for analogues that achieve many of the same purpose as verification and that apply to these topics.

Argumentation is such an analogue.
<ul>
	<li>There is mutual agreement on the procedures to be followed.</li>
	<li>The norms of candor and sincerity are shared.</li>
	<li>Reflective judgment is the goal.</li>
	<li>The knowledge that one's views may be challenged creates an incentive to search for arguments of high quality.</li>
</ul>
The view that argumentation is a way of knowing has two important corollaries. In the realm of the uncertain, truth is relative to the argument that is advanced for it. We know through interaction with others; if the self is a composite of what we know, it is developed through interaction with others.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Trust in the power of reason was shattered during the early 20th century. Social science dealt more with empirical realities than with normative claims. Freudian psychology emphasized unconscious motivation. Crowd psychology focused on how people behave differently when they are grouped together. Disillusionment that followed World War I fueled awareness of the power of propaganda.

During the 1920s, it became fashionable to argue against the competence of public judgment. Walter Lippmann, for example, maintained that public opinion had been disastrously wrong at the critical junctures of history. The reason, he claimed, was a commitment to the false ideal of the competent citizen.

More recently, Lippmann and others have suggested that it is possible to cultivate a "public philosophy" that reinstates the place of reason in civic discussion. The public philosophy requires awareness Â of society's social knowledge. It requires advocates who are able to "stand in" for the public and speak on its behalf. Making claims on behalf of the public demands that the advocate make strong claims and defend them ably. Training in argumentation helps one to prevent weak claims from triumphing over strong ones. Argumentation legitimizes freedom of speech and, thereby, permits a free society to function.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ethical considerations figure prominently in argumentation. Any attempt to influence other people raises ethical issues. It is a limitation on freedom of choice. It is the application of superior to inferior force. But argumentation seeks to achieve ethical influence. It does not influence people against their will but seeks their free assent. Without influence, the conditions of society and community are not possible. Argumentation respects different ways of thinking and reasoning.

		<title>Perception and Internal Models</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Humans are not in direct contact with the external world but pick up cues as to what is in the external world and form models from these cues. Because this process is so automatic, we need to be reminded of this fact through parables and perceptual illusions. One reason our internal models are different from the external world is that we have sensory limitations.

For example, we are tuned to only a small part of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum, which we egocentrically call <em>light</em>. Imagine if someone turned on the rest of the spectrum, so that you now saw infrared light, ultraviolet light, radio waves, and microwaves, and you were experiencing all radio stations, TV stations, cell phone calls, and so on at the same time.

Likewise for sound, we are sensitive to sound waves only in the 20,000-Hz to 200-Hz range. We do not hear dog whistles, bat radar, and similar sounds.

For smell, we can pick up only some of the chemicals floating around in the air; egocentrically, we say that the rest are odorless.

We are good at picking up rather subtle cues to form our internal models. When there are ambiguous cues, we can entertain more than one internal model, and our active perceptual system can alternate these models, overriding our consciousÂ control.

In some cases, our internal models are not in correspondence with external reality, and we see visual illusions, such as lines of different lengths when the lines are equal, squares of different grey shades when the shades are the same, and curved lines when lines are straight.

		<title>The Naked Ape</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mammals evolved about 200 million years ago, and about 85 million years ago, some of these evolved into primates.Â These primates lived largely in the forests and probably led a nomadic life, moving as food supplies were depleted.

About 35 million years ago, apes evolved.

About 10 million years ago, the forest began to disappear and our ancestors had to change in ways that allowed them to compete successfully with the plains animals that were highly evolved to fit that environment.

Between 5 and 4 million years ago, our ancestors evolved the ability to walk on two legs; among the many reasons why this adaptation might have been advantageous is to free up the hands.

During the evolution of our ancestors, many changes apparently took place to make them competitive with the plains animals.
<ul>
	<li>One important change is called <em>neoteny</em>, the process by which birth occurs much earlier in the development of the organism, allowing the brain and behavior to develop according to the requirements of the environment.</li>
	<li>The brain size increased markedly.</li>
	<li>Pair bonding of a man and woman also had to develop in order to rear the inept offspring.</li>
	<li>As meat replaced some of the vegetarian diet, cooperative hunting by the men was required.</li>
	<li>The nomadic way of life was also apparently replaced with a territorial existence.</li>
</ul>
In his 1967 book <em>The Naked Ape</em>, Desmond Morris emphasizes several adaptations that must have taken place within the context of the evolution of humans.

He asks the question:" Why are we the only naked [relatively] ape?"
<ul>
	<li>There are several hypothesized possibilities, including problems with cleanliness and even possibly diseases carried by fleas.</li>
	<li>Another possibility is that nakedness led to more satisfying sex.</li>
	<li>A third possibility is that there was an aquatic phase during which fur would have been problematic.</li>
	<li>The most widely accepted version is that the loss of hair led to our ancestor's ability to cool down as they engaged in the long-distance running required to chase down game during hunting.</li>
</ul>
Although our ancestors couldn't fast, humans can outrun almost all other animals, includingÂ animals even like horses. Again, not very fast, takes them a lot time to do it, but humans run long distances. That's probably how our ancestors hunted. But again, they can't do that with a fur coat.

Morris also asks why we are the sexiest of the apes.
<ul>
	<li>He suggests that although sex is, of course, necessary for reproduction, the vast majority of sex engaged in by humans occurs when impregnation is not possible; thus, it must be for the purpose of holding the pair bond together.</li>
	<li>The development of many physical features, such as breasts, lips and earlobes, along with face-to-face sex, led to enhanced sex pleasure.</li>
	<li>Behavioral changes also led to a strengthening of the pair bond, such as the constant receptivity of women and the privacy of the sex act.</li>
</ul>
However, problems come about today because of a mismatch of our current environment with evolved tendencies, such as the constant exposure of men and women to members of the opposite sex who give off strong evolved sexual signals.

Morris also asks why modern humans have used aggression to push themselves to the brink of annihilation.
<ul>
	<li>He suggests that aggression, particularly for animals with strong male competition, is inevitable.</li>
	<li>However, in animals with killing weapons, such as teeth and claws, as the killing weapons evolved, there also evolved behavioral inhibitions about using these weapons on member of their own species.</li>
	<li>In humans, our most effective killing weapons are products of technology rather than evolution, and the time span during which they were developed is far too short for behavioral inhibitions against their use to have evolved.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Darwin had a difficult time explaining altruistic behavior because, by definition, that behavior puts an individual's survival at risk without reproductive gain.

However, William Hamilton put more emphasis on the survival of the genetic material. In this case, individual is just a temporary life-support system that the genetic material lives in while it tries to replicate itself in order to become immortal.

Hamilton proposed that some altruistic behavior is the result of <em>inclusive fitness</em>, that is, behaving in ways that improve the survival and reproduction of all our relatives, not just our children.

Support for Hamilton's rule, formula 'c &lt; rb'--we will act if the cost to ourselves is less than our relatedness to the other person times the benefit to the other person--is found in research on the warning behavior of ground squirrels, human wills, and human helping behavior.

Differential parental investment, the much greater time, effort, and resources devoted by the woman to a child, helps explain the different mating strategies of men and women.

Men have a mixed strategy of both trying to impregnate as many woman as possible and establishÂ a more permanent relationship with a high-quality mate and devoting resources to the resulting offspring. Women primarily follow the latter strategy.

The differences in these strategies predicts the findings of much research, including the fact that men are much more agreeable to casual sex, desire sex with more partners, are more upset by sexual infidelity than romantic infidelity, and more interested in fertility, as exemplified by youth and physical beauty, and less interested in financial prospects of mates than are women.

Evolutionary psychology can also help explain some of the problems with aggression, parenting, and overeating in today's world.

Men are by far the deadlier sex in terms of both homicides and wars. Because of competition for reproductive women, men's genes have predisposed them to be aggressive and take more risks. As predicted by the theory, unmarried and unemployed men, particularly those in their prime reproductive years, are the most likely to kill other men or be killed by them.

Men kill other men because if status or jealous and kill women because of suspected infidelity. Women's aggression tends to take the form of verbal derogation of rivals. Men exclusively engage in war by forming cooperative alliances to attain the resources for sexual reproduction.

Some of the conflicts in families can be explained by considering the relatedness of the various parties.

The majority of parenting is done by mothers, perhaps because fathers are uncertain of their fatherhood or because they want to devote resources to other mating opportunities.

As predicted by evolutionary theory, step fathers are much more likely to abuse or kill stepchildren than biologically related children, particularly when the children are young.

The fact that our population is increasingly overweight can be partially attributed to our bodies' tendency to adjust metabolic levels to maintain weight and to our built-in tasteÂ for foods that we can store on our bodies in the form of fat. In addition, our ancestors gave us an aversion to unnecessary exercise.

The unhealthy mismatch of our built-in tendencies with the current environment is an example of the naturalistic fallacy.

		<title>The Idea Of Gentlemen Amateur And The Decline of The British Empire</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=987</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By the late 19 century, the highestÂ award in British life didn't go to the industrialists. They went instead to the gentlemen. And the idea of the gentlemen amateur was corrosive to British industrial supremacy.

In America, to say someone is professional isÂ meant to be high praise. It suggests they do a job and they do it very well indeed. But in Britain, the highest praise is reservedÂ for the amateur: somebody who does something simply because their love of it.

In British life, the most prestigious job you could have was to not have a job at all. Leisure was a higher status than hard work.Â What that meant was that it was relatively unusual for industrial dynasties to develop inside British life.

Whereas in America, you gotÂ families like the Vanderbilt, where one generation after the next, Â each one builds on the achievements of the previous one.

What tended to happen in Britain isÂ that a manÂ made a fortune in industry, would then sent his son to Eton, and then to Oxford and Cambridge. And thereÂ the ethos was very much one of learning how to be a leisured gentlemen. And very often, the sons trained in that way, Â would spend the money they inherited from their fathers to buy their way into the landed classes, rather than remaining committed to industrialization, whose social prestige was comparatively lower.

However, a social situation which is in someway attractive does carry costs. You could imagine that if people are moving out of industry into the leisured landed classes, Â rather than reinvesting everything in the factory, sooner or later they are goingÂ to get left behind. Especially they are up against American competitors, or German competitors, who have different ideas about what carries status and prestige.

By 1900, the British empire started to become a place in which the British would shelter behind their relatively inefficient industrial system. As they started to lose ground, they started to use the empire to compensate.

Here is the historian Paul Johnson. He says:
<blockquote>... it is not surprising that the English, confronted by growing evidence that they were no longer the world's leading industrial power, sought redress and relief not in an economic solution but in a political one. They did not use the State to become more efficient. They used the State to enlarge the area in which their inefficiency would matter less.

In short, they invented modern imperialism. This was, or at any rate seemed to be, the easy way out. But it was a choice directed not by strength but by weakness. Unable to compete successfully in the developed markets, the English turned to a further exploitation and enlargement of their sphere of influence in the backward parts of the world.</blockquote>
And that was a prelude to the return toÂ protectionism and the creation of a free trade area within the empire, while trying to keep the Germans and Americans out.

But of course, once the colonies got self-government, that internal wasÂ going toÂ be difficult. Because the politician in the newly independent colonies would necessarily be tempted to find trading with Americans, where the commodities cost less, the more of better quality, more attractive, than holding on to trade with Britain.

		<title>Risk, Return and Diversification</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone seems to think that as you bear more risk, you'll earn a higher return, but this really isn't true. In fact, it's an oversimplification of the true relationship between risk and return. The truth is that some risks, called systematic risks, are highly rewarded while others, called idiosyncratic risks, are worth nothing.

The actual return on an investment is the sum of the expected return and the unexpected return:

R_i = E_i + U_i,

where R is the actual return, E is the expected return, U is the unexpected return, and the subscript i references the type of asset that this is. The unexpected return could be positive or negative.

What is risk? In this framework, risk is getting a negative value for the unexpected return, U.

Now, let's introduce diversification: the practice of investing in several or many different assets rather than only one or a few assets.

Diversification isn't just about making sure that you limit your total loss by spreading out the risk; it actually reduces risk.Â For example, if the actual return is R_i = E_i + U_i and you only have one asset-- asset 1--then the actual return is going to fully reflect both the expected return and the unexpected return on asset 1.

However, what if you added another asset, asset 2, to your investment portfolio? If you assume that 1/2 of your savings are invested in each asset, then you can calculate the total return to your portfolio by adding the returns of both assets and dividing by 2. Then, your total return is given by this equation:

portfolio return = 1/2 * (R_1 + R_2) = 1/2 * (E_1 + E_2) + 1/2 * (U_1 + U_2),

where U_1 and U_2 are the unexpected returns from each asset.

Each unexpected return may be positive or negative, or one may be positive and the other may be negative. When one is positive and the other is negative, then they tend to cancel each other out--at least a little.

In short, the more assets you add, the more offsetting of unexpected returns you'll get.

However, there is a limit to diversification. Â Even if you have the most well-diversified portfolio, you will still experience unexpected returns because diversification reduces risk but can't eliminate it.

The type of risk that diversification reduces, through this cancelation process, is called idiosyncratic risk, which is a risk that is specific to each particular asset and doesn't share anything in common with any other assets--it's not correlated across assets. When we increase the number of assets in a portfolio, we expect that, on average, the idiosyncratic risks will cancel each other out--that the actual return will get closer to the expected return.

The other type of risk in the unexpected return is called systematic risk, which is a risk that is common across assets--meaning that when this risk creates a positive unexpected return in oneÂ asset, it's doing the same thing to all other risky assets. Systematic risk is risk that you can't get rid of through diversification.

Economists still can't quite agree on what causes systematic risk. There are many ideas, but they all seem to be similar. Most theories about the sources of systematic risk involve risks to the overall economy, to the financial markets, or to both.

Economists know that people are risk averse, but if you compensate them, they'll bear it. Additionally, if there's a risk that they have to pay to get rid of, they'll probably put up with at least some of it. However, if there is a risk that we can get rid of for free, no risk-averse person would pass up the chance to eliminate that risk.

Diversification gets rid of idiosyncratic risk, and you don't have to pay extra to diversify your portfolio, especially if you choose a prediversified asset like a mutual fund. Therefore, there's no reason to expect compensation for bearing idiosyncratic risk.

System risk is the risk that you can't get rid of, so in order to induce a risk-averse person to hold an asset with systematic risk, they have to be compensated for that. The compensation comes in the form of a higher expected return from holding that asset--relative to an asset with no systematic risk.

The relationship between risk and return is that higher systematic risk leads to higher expected return. You only get paid to hold systematic risk, not all risk, and you can only expect to get paid--you won't necessarily get all the compensation you demand. Of course, if you hold the asset long enough, then your actual compensation should come close to the expected return.

There are many different theories about what determines investment returns, but they all agree that idiosyncratic risk is worthless while systematic risk is compensated. Furthermore, they all agree that any asset that has no systematic risk should earn the risk-free rate of return--the return on a government bond. Even an asset with a highly risky return should only earn the risk-free rate on average, if all the risk is idiosyncratic risk.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...

You weren't alone when you bore your shield in defense of the allied fleet; a crowd was behind you, while only one person accompanied me.

If he wasn't aware that fighters come lower than thinkers and prizes aren't owed to a strong right arm, however unflinching, he'd claim those weapons himself, and so would Ajax the lesser, warlike Eurypylus, Thoas the son of the famous Andraemon; so would Idomeneus, Meriones his companion from Crete, and royal Agamemnon's younger brother, the brave Menelaus.

Of course they are sturdy warriors, fully my equals in battle - but not in the tactics of warfare.

Your physical might serves well on the filed, but your limited powers of thinking need my direction. Your strength is mindless, where my concern is to plan ahead. You surely can fight, but it's I who advises the king when he's choosing the critical moment for action.

Your simple brawn must be measured against my brains. In a ship the helmsman take precedence over the rower; in war the commander has more respect than the soldier; so I must rank above you.Â In the make-up of human beings, intelligence counts for more than our hands, and that is our true strength.

'Princes of Greece, I call on you now to reward your watchman. Reward me for all those years of anxious and careful devotion. I ask you to give me the prize which I'm owed for my dutiful service. Â My work is complete: by removing obstacle fate had imposed, by enabling the capture of Illium's towers, I achieved their capture. By all the hopes that we share by the toppling defenses of Troy, in the name of the gods whose aid I recently stole from the foe, by anything yet to be done where intelligent action is needed, remember Ulysses! Or else, If it cannot be mine, let this armor be hers!' - and he pointed towards the fateful image of Pallas.

- Ovid, &lt;Metamorphoses&gt;

So the thing that one longsÂ to get back to, before anything else, is whatever place there may be where one could feel at home, and that is because it is in that place--and in that place alone--where one would really like to feel at home. That place is the word of the Greeks.

		<title>American Romanticism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This was not a uniquely American development. Â The disasters of the French Revolution has shown Europeans how far short reason mightÂ fall of perfection.

And from the pens of Â Goethe, Schiller, Beethoven, Wordsworth, and RungeÂ broke forth a common waveÂ of protest against the Enlightenment, which today we call Romanticism.

And just how pervasive the romantic revolt could be, can be seen how it touched legal theory.

The rule of lawyers like Hamilton and Jefferson, was preeminently rule of Enlightenment reason. Resentment of that rule broke out into criticism of law as a profession and glorification of an ordinary justice based on honesty and equity over against legal theory.

Andrew Jackson may have been the best example of this Romantic anti-Legalism. But its most popular example was the legendary Tennessee congressman Davy Crockett,Â whose legal thinking could be reduced toÂ this one single and favorite legal maximÂ of his:
<blockquote>Be sure you are right, then go ahead.</blockquote>
No application of reason. No application of complex notions and theories. Just be sure you are right. There's a appeal there whichÂ balances almost on the brink of doing what you feel is right. And that was anÂ expression of Romanticism.

-- Allen C. Guelzo]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Affluent Society And Education</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[American intellectuals in the 1950s worried that althoughÂ America was certainly becoming a wealthyÂ society, it wasÂ becoming excessively conformist . That it wasÂ losing the distinctiveÂ individuality whichÂ madeÂ America great inÂ the first place.

Perhaps the most influential book to make this case is called "The Lonely Crowd" by David Riesman, which argued that American individualism was in decline.

RiesmanÂ uses a kind of social psychology model, saying if we look at people inÂ traditional societies, individuals are tradition-directed. They take the view: this is what we do, this is what we always done, this is what we are going to continue to do. In other words, you fit into a tradition with the expectation the life always carry on theÂ way it does now.

By contrast, said Riesman, the Industrial Revolution created the inner-directed personality. That is the person who guided by what Riesman called hisÂ inner gyroscope, is highly directed toward changing the world in particular ways, has a very high degree of self-confidence, and goes after his goals single-mindedly. That's the personality type which created this amazing abundant America.

But now, Riesman argued, the inner-directed personality is being displaced by the other-directed personality. The kind of person who doesn't have the absolute self-confidenceÂ ofÂ one of the great entrepreneur-ing pioneers, which insteadÂ is weak in internal resources. And instead get his or her validation by looking outside to others - the reassurance which comes from being part of a group or part of a team. Conformity, Riesman argued, is becoming the normal characteristic of the American other-directed personality.

...

Other intellectuals pointed out in the 50s that advertisingÂ was more and more shaping Americans' view of themselves and their world.

...

And the historian David Porter wrote an influential study of the American character called "People of Plenty", in which he pointed out withinÂ America ofÂ the 1950s, far more money was being spent on advertising than was being spent on either education or religion.

In other words, if you compare where people get their ideas from: church, school, and the ads, most of the money going into thoseÂ thing is going on the ads. That is surely a deplorable state of affairs.

Story at the end of the Korean war showed that American prisoners of war, prisoners taken in Korea, have been very vulnerable to brainwashing. That is they hadn't hadÂ the inner psychological resources toÂ resist the mental assault on them of their capturers. This also seemsÂ likeÂ further evidences of the decline of the internal gyroscope.

So parents understandably worried about their children's future in this complex word.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of their words for America was "The Great Satan".Â And this is a phrase which was first heard in the Iranian Revolution back in 1980, and crocked up periodically in the rhetoric of the Islam fundamentalists.

And the American immigrant writer Dinesh D'Souza has this insight in his book "What's so great about America", which describes America's achievement of assimilatingÂ new generations of people. He says:

In a way, it is true that America is the Great Satan. Because Satan is a tempter. And America is full of temptations.

It's an oddly shrewd remark. But he says the superiority of America comes from the fact that in America although you are tempted, at least you have the freedom and opportunity to choose to be virtuous. It doesn't mean everybody will make the right choice, at least you have the opportunity to choose.

Where as in Islamic regimes, you are not given the choice at all. You are forced to do the right thing. And of course, once you are forced, there is no virtual in it. It's simply a matter of coercion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The immense vitality and diversity of American life have been underlain by certain recurrent themes.

First, America's development has differed from that of most of the rest of the world: in religiosity, in national confidence and sense of destiny, and in the nation's incredible good fortune.

Second, and closely related, America has enjoyed unprecedented wealth, and abundance of raw materials, plenty of entrepreneurial and inventive talent, and gradual widening of the population that could share in the benefits of prosperity. By the millennium, it set standards for the rest of the world to follow and was a decisive leader of the whole world's economy.

Third, its political and social system ensured that citizens enjoyed a wide range of freedoms, that its class system was fluid, and that democracy was as much as a reality as an aspiration.

Fourth, it was more successful than any other nation in brining immigrants from every corner of the world and assimilating them into the American system.

Compared to its high ideals, America always fell short. Compared to the other nations of the world, however, America was far more impressive for its successes than its failings.

		<title>Socrates on Knowledge, Experience and Governance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So we have at once if not a solution to the problem of knowledge, a recognition of just what it is that makes knowledge problematical.

Knowledge is problematical owning to the slavish reliance on experience.Â As if experience could teach us things like this:

Clearly every man, woman and child, as well as most of the creatures of the animal kingdom have experiences minute by minute, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty five days a year.

And yet the world is home to villains and fools, a few wise men, distracted people, the mad, the weird, the mentally deficient. There's a panoply of human types and types of lives, and it's idle to attempt to discriminate between or within groups such asÂ these on the basis of experience. For experience is ubiquitous.

The villains of history are rich in their experiential backgrounds. And few saints we ever known are any richer in their experiential background, perhaps not very rich at all.

Well the point is this: you can't make distinctions between the wise and the foolish on the basis of who has more experience. And if you can't make distinctions between the wise and the foolish on that basis, then on what basis will you make the distinction?

That is say to add up that which itself never reaches the fundamental truth is to engage an enterprise that is entirely nugatory.

Well then, the experiences of eleven people will not amount to anything verses the experiences of one. And if the experiences of eleven thousand amount no more than the experiences of one, the implications for democratic or majoritarian rule are clear.

You begin to see then, that Socrates is going to get in trouble in the radically Athenian state in which he finds himself.

		<title>Protagoras on Gods</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Protagoras's position on religious matters, reminiscent of Homeric epic, appears in the only surviving fragment of his treatise On Gods:
<blockquote>About the gods, I cannot say either that they are or that they are not, nor how they are constituted in shape. There is so much that prevents knowledge of this kind: the uncertainty of the subject and the shortness of human life.</blockquote>
<ol>
 	<li>The fact that our lives are measured in hours set a limit on what we can know. Truth comes from no transcendental realm beyond human ken; all we know is that opinions vary and that what one man will die for, another will scoff at as absurd.</li>
 	<li>In this way, each man becomes the measure of all things, and the possibility of a coherent transpersonal body of knowledge is beyond reach.</li>
</ol>
The contribution of pre-Socratic philosophers takes the form of robust skeptical challenges to customary beliefs. Socrates, too, examines these beliefs but also the challenges. In the process, he shifts philosophical attention from the cosmos to the human condition itself. He will argue that each of us not only fails to be the measure of all things but we are generally very poor in our understanding of our very selves.

		<title>Metaphysics, Ontology and Epistemology</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=1092</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The word metaphysics derives from the writing of Aristotle and means, "after the physics," or "after the study of natural science." It asks essentially, two questions: "What is there" and "How do I know?"

The first question is ontological, that is, concerned with questions regarding the constituents of reality. For example, do minds exist, or thoughts?
<ol>
 	<li>How do we go about answering such questions? Observations alone is insufficient. There is far more to reality than what is accessible to our senses.</li>
 	<li>Pythagoras had an abstract, rationalistic method for answering ontological questions that was largely intuitive and in which observation played no part.</li>
</ol>
We have at least two methods with which to approach the problem of knowing what exists, but we are left with the task of choosing between them. The rationalistic method may offer an account of reality that is not supported at the level of perception. Which account is to be preferred and on what basis?

Thus, we arrive at the second question, which springs from epistemology--the study of our claims to know. How do we know that reality is one thing or many things? To ask what there is is always to ask how we know what is.
<ol>
 	<li>Further, to declare that our senses deceive us or are incapable of reaching certain levels of reality is to make an epistemological claim.</li>
 	<li>If we know that our senses deceive us, we must have some non-deceptive--and non-perceptual--mode of discovery against which we can weigh the evidence of the senses.</li>
 	<li>What is this method of discovery for registering the truth of the world? Logic? Mathematics? Science? Religion?</li>
 	<li>These are questions of epistemology, meaning the study, criticism, and refinement of our very modes of knowing, the study of our knowledge as such.</li>
 	<li>Many of our most significant claims are actually beliefs rather than knowledge. We believe, for example, that the laws of science will still be operating tomorrow, but we cannot actually "know" what tomorrow will bring. Clearly, however, our belief in the laws of nature is different from a guess. How do we justify such a belief and distinguish it from guessing? This question pertains to what is referred to as epistemic justification.</li>
</ol>
Obviously, the two branches of metaphysics--ontology and epistemology--are inextricably bound together. To answer the question "What is there?" is already to have adopted a method. To adopt a method is already to have taken a position on the sorts of things that method might uncover.
<ol>
 	<li>It is not solely in the philosophy seminar that these matters tax the intellectual resources. In daily life, we are continuously confronted by ontological and epistemological questions. Should I believe what I read in the newspapers? What medical advice is really sound? Do I die with my body or might there be a life after this one? Is there such a thing as goodness?</li>
 	<li>As we begin to supply answers to these questions, we have adopted a method and may discover that the answers we've reached were more or less guaranteed given the method.</li>
</ol>

		<title>Medea and Antigone</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The psychological depth and philosophical complexity of Greek classical drama can be seen in the dilemmas of Euripides's Medea and Sophocles' Antigone. We first look at Medea.

Was Medea guilty of murder? The killing of children by a parent is the most "unnatural" of acts, but her act might be seen as a natural revenge proportionate to the crime committed against her and, thus, fitting or "meet".

Revenge of this sort harks back to an earlier, pre-juridical world--the world of the law of revenge, when the chthonic gods of the earth held sway and the Olympian gods of light were still in the future, a world in which the pleadings of heart trump the demands of rationality.
<ol>
 	<li>The older religion was associated with birth and renewal, with crops and nurturing, and identified the female with all that was sustaining; the bond of mother and child was the fundamental social bond. At this most primitive level is where Medea's creative and destructive energies reside.</li>
 	<li>In the classical period, this pattern is reversed. The Olympian religion installed Zeus as chief among the gods, the superiority of the male was uncontested. In Aeschylus's drama of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, Clytemnestra's crime (killing her husband) is judged to be worse than Orestes' crime (killing his mother) by the Olympian Athena, because Clytemnestra's crime is that she killed a man.</li>
 	<li>Medea harkens to an older perspective, so different from our own that she seems to us, and to Euripides's audience, as simply mad. Indeed, Medea seems to be more driven than driving. Something of the mystery of earth itself impels her movements, has her sacrifice her sons to return them to the earth, to revive the cycle and have it conclude more satisfactorily.</li>
 	<li>In a key moment, as she kisses and caresses the children she is about to murder, Medea describes her own dilemma without being able to alter it:
<blockquote>Go, leave me; I cannot bear to see you any longer.
Overcome by grief, now I understand what I am about to do;
Passion--that cause of our most dire woes--
Has vanquished my rational power.</blockquote>
</li>
 	<li>Euripides develops characters more accessible than the Olympians: the mysterious and powerful but jilted woman, cheated by her opportunistic and aggressive husband, who finds "honor" chiefly in externals. Medea's impulses spring from beneath the earth; his, from what is above it.</li>
 	<li>Perhaps because this is a rather modern saga, many of Euripides' contemporary critics thought it was uninstructive. It didn't accomplish what they regarded as the mission of theatre--not to depict the entities we are but to show us how good character leads to good ends. Euripides understood the tension between the earthly, chthonic life as it is lived and the ideal realm of moral imperatives.</li>
</ol>
We also find in Euripides, and in nearly all the Greek dramatists, the central canon that <em>character is destiny</em>.
<ol>
 	<li>The word <em>nomos</em>Â is pivotal here. As understood in the vocabulary of the ancient philosopher, <em>nomos</em> is not what is merely customary, but what is lawful, as in the very laws of nature. And in the same age, in the context of law and society, <em>nomos</em>, again, is not merely the customary practices but what is utterly binding as a legal percept.</li>
 	<li>How are we to understand the law? Is the law something naturally right? Is it something imposed? Does it arise from our very nature? Is it counter to our nature?</li>
 	<li>Medea's crime is "unnatural," but being driven by passion is natural. It is possible to recognize that you have passed beyond reason and be unable to stop yourself.</li>
</ol>
Medea is one of the commanding women of the ancient Greek world, a group that includes Aphrodite, Athena, Antigone, Andromache, the Theban women, Clytemnestra, Penelope, and others.
<ol>
 	<li>Despite their actual position of reclusive subservience in the ancient world, women are portrayed with greatness by the ancient Greek dramatists.</li>
 	<li>This prominence in literature seems to be a recognition of the power of Eros, the ancient understanding that what brings men and women together is not just a creative force, not just something that brings about life and repopulates the world, but also a powerfully destructive force. Because what we will do at the bidding of Eros is what Medea does.</li>
</ol>
Nomos as custom, nomos as law, and nature (physics) begin to merge and diverge as the classical world faces increasing complexity of thought and practice. The story of Antigone illustrates.

Where Medea surrenders to her passion, Antigone's passion reaches a universal principle.
<ol>
 	<li>Antigone violates Creon's order not to bury her dead brother out of her conviction that <em>nomos</em>--the law of the land--is more ancient than the orders of kings and that her duty to bury her brother is a universal one; a later age will call it <em>natural law</em>.</li>
 	<li>Beneath all our allegiances to king and custom is a deeper allegiance to nature that we must have in order for there to be kings and customs. To this allegiance, Antione subscribes.</li>
</ol>
Medea's passion is a form of madness in which reason is surrendered: a form of ignorance. Antigone's passion is akin to knowledge. Antigone<em> knows herself</em>: She knows what she should do, the wises of kings notwithstanding. She doesn't want to have to do it, hates the idea of dying for it, but she does it.

Both Greek drama and Greek philosophy would propose "Know thyself." The resulting knowledge was scarcely reassuring. Even if we are careful, wise, and moderate and avoid <em>hubris</em>, dreadful things often befall us. Philosophy will have to address this tragic dilemma at the core of existence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If Herodotus's history of the Persian war succeeds as a descriptive psychology of human nature under conditions of stress and strain, it is less successful as an accurate historical account of events.

Herodotus has been accused by later ages of having written bad history, telling of encounters between people who could not have met. Yet throughout the work, Herodotus pauses to alert readers to interpretations that are based chiefly on the opinions of the author or to records of events that he did not witness.

His account includes parables, morality tales that communicate the lessons of history: What happens if we are cowardly? What do we stand to gain if we are brave and decent? In this way, Herodotus addresses the <em>problem of conduct</em>.
<ol>
 	<li>The dialogue of Croesus and Solon--the man famous for wealth and the man famous for knowledge--is not intended to be historical; it is a disquisition on the nature of happiness.</li>
 	<li>Croesus asks Solon who the happiest man in the world is, obviously expecting the reply to be that it is Croesus himself. Instead, Solon tells the story of Cleobis and Biton, asserting that they are the happiest men in the world because they died in a state of being that all would honor and aspire to emulate.</li>
 	<li>Happiness is not fame or riches or heroic virtue, but a state that will inspire posterity to think, in reflecting upon another's life, that it was the life one would wish to live. We can say of no man that he is <em>eudaimonios</em>, that his was a truly flourishing life, until his days are over.</li>
</ol>
These two elements that Herodotus addresses--the problem of knowledge and the problem of conduct--raise the issue of the problem of governance.
<ol>
 	<li>We know that the ancient Athenian democracy had to save itself from what would have been the tyrannical rule of the Persians. It turns out, however, that the Athenian democracy was not saved by the Athenians but the Spartans.</li>
 	<li>In illuminating this fact, Herodotus passes to Plato and Aristotle a historical perspective on a paradoxical question of governance: In the attempt to cultivate virtue, must one be battle-hardened?</li>
 	<li>Plato, like Herodotus, would recognize that in the spectacle of war, the truths of our morality can be learned as in no other way, but his conclusion is worrisome. Are strife and conflict necessary if character is to be formed? Perhaps as an answer, Herodotus gives us the story of Cleobis and Biton, suggesting that there are alternatives to warfare in the cultivation of virtue.</li>
</ol>

		<title>Socrates on the Examined Life</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Why did Socrates choose suicide? Because he recognized that the rule of law is the corporate or public expression of human rationality itself. Law is the means by which rational power of corruptible man might minimize corruption. Having devoted his life to rationality, Socrates would not abandon everything he had stood for and taught merely because his own situation was compromised.

"The unexamined life is not worth living": Why? And if this is true, how are we to examine our lives?

What is the matter with a life of perfect satisfaction and gratification that is based on an illusion--provided by drugs or machines?

Socrates did not live in our technical world of microsurgery and pharmacology; thus, in Plato's Republic, he considers prisoner in the depth of a cave who have objects and events projected on some parapet in front of them. They think they are experiencing reality, but this reality is no more than mere shadows and illusion.

What Socrates makes clear is that behind every experience, this is room for an interpretation of the meaning of that experience. It's in the interpretation, the examination of what life amounts to, that in fact, life becomes worth living. For Socrates, it's not the sequence of passive experiences but the integration of those experiences into some intelligible whole that constitutes a form of life, and one subject to refinement through self-critical reflection.

This returns us to the Delphic pronouncement: "Know thyself." But how we can do this?
<ol>
 	<li>We must know what it means to be a certain kind of being, in this case, what it means to be a human being. The answer must reach toward something other than mere biology, which may be a way to understand a particular species but certainly can't answer the question: "What kind of person am I essentially?"</li>
 	<li>Socrates's life as a teacher was devoted to the question: "What kind of beings are we?" Only after reaching a defensible position on that question might we proceed to "How should we live our lives? What is the right form of government? What's the relationship between the individual and the polis?"</li>
</ol>
To know thyself presupposes the capacity to know anything. You may know many things and not "know thyself" in the Socratic sense. But to know thyself is, minimally, to know. Thus, Socrates begins with that core problem of knowledge: how do we know anything?
<ol>
 	<li>If the skeptics are right in that we can't know anything for certain, then we certainly cannot know ourselves in any settled and certain way, and that means that one's life is uselessly examined. Â What would the examined life be? Simply a constellation of prejudices and self-deceptions.</li>
 	<li>What must be defeated here is skepticism. We must come up with at least one kernel of truth that we can settle on as true and that will answer the root epistemological question: Is it possible to know anything? if we can settle on one thing that is true, then we can know that it is possible to know, and if we know the method by which we arrived at that truth, then perhaps we can use it to know other things.</li>
</ol>
We begin to see that the Socratic agenda is a fairly broad one. First, one must do philosophical battle with skepticism and cynicism. One must also contend with the problem of conduct. What kind of life is right for beings such as ourselves? Should we aim solely at happiness and pleasure? What of our values? Are they simply refections of our own prejudices, giving us no right or reason to impose them on others or expect them to be shared?

Nonetheless, Socrates reserves to himself the right at least to raise the question: How should we be governed? This question cannot be answered in the abstract. We can't answer the question of how we should be governed unless we have already established the right kind of life to live. And we can't answer that question until we've settled the question of what kind of beings we are and how we can come to know as much.

Until we have successfully defeated a skeptical position on knowledge as such, we can't have a defensible position on ethics. And until we've handled the ethical dimensions of life, we can't pinpoint that the political organization of the polis should be.

It is a credit to the lasting genius of Socrates that he understands the interconnectedness of these questions, that the problem of knowledge, the problem of conduct, and the problem of governance are various phases of the same problem: how we come to know ourselves and realize our humanity in the course of a lifetime. This, of course, will be central agenda of the program of philosophy for centuries to come.

		<title>Can Virtue Be Taught?</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=1130</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To teach anything one must know what it is. What is virtue? Is it one thing or many?

Are justice, holiness, and temperance separate virtues or parts of virtue as a whole? It makes a difference, because if they are separate, it should be possible for a person to be, for example, just but intemperate or holy but unjust. Protagoras's answer, that these qualities are parts of virtue, introduces confusion. If justice is separate from and not in any way like temperance, then temperance must match up with what is not just, that is, with injustice!

Socrates then pursues the question of whether virtue can be taught. Why would he raise this question? Socrates appreciates that there's something about moral excellence that defies merely academic exercises or pedagogical undertakings. There seems to be something in the human being that reflects, generates, expresses virtue. How can something of this nature be "taught?"

We do not say of persons that they are virtuous in the morning but no so in the afternoon. We tend to think that a person is virtuous when there is a quality about the person that expresses itself in almost every context. For that to be the case, it must be because the actions of the person are guided by a principle or precept that is at once unified an universally applicable.

Obedience to this principle is not blind, however. Expressions of virtue presuppose knowledge; courage, for example, arises not from ignorance of what is involved in one's actions but with full knowledge of the risks.

Thus, virtue seems to be a quality regulative of conduct, but if it is universal, then it cannot be accessed by the senses. The senses can pick up only particulars, not universals. If behind persons of virtue, there stands a universal principle, an impelling principle, applicable in all contexts and known in some non-sensory way, then virtue is like the Pythagorean theorem--a matter of relationships.

If virtue cannot be learned by experience--that is, by some sort of perceptual activity--then how can it be taught at all?
<ol>
 	<li>In most contents, we teach by pointing to instances of what we are teaching, but we cannot point to virtue, which is a universal. A universal precept cannot be the subject of ostensible definition.</li>
 	<li>For Socrates, if virtue cannot be taught, then there is no point in teaching at all. Teaching is reduced to a kind of training, as in training to be a welder.</li>
</ol>
We might argue that we cannot point to virtue, but we can point to instances of virtue, just as we can point to right triangles, which though not perfect, are instances of the relation a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
<ol>
 	<li>This approach presents another problem: A one-year-old child shown the heroism of the Spartans at Thermopylae can learn nothing from it. The soul must be prepared and of the right disposition; there must be guidance, as Meno's servant required guidance to discover that he knew the Pythagorean theorem.</li>
 	<li>Thus, Socrates argues that virtue cannot be taught as such. However, if knowledge attained by philosophical reflection is the necessary ingredient in virtue, this can be taught.</li>
 	<li>Again, not all are ready to be "taught" virtue in this sense. The students for this instruction must have the background and propensity to resonate when a virtuous act presents itself. We cannot teach virtue by presenting instances of virtuous actions to a person whose should has been so corrupted as not to be able to enter into a kind of sympathetic relationship with the exemplum.</li>
 	<li>We have here the foundations for a kind of elitist position on who shall be virtuous, which we will confront again in Plato's Republic. The life of virtue is not available to anybody and everybody--it requires a certain kind of person.</li>
 	<li>We also see the foundations for an essentially developmental theory. If one is ever to be in a position where the lessons of virtue make some impact, it must be because from the earliest time in childhood, one's soul was conditioned in such a way as to be receptive to lessons of this kind.</li>

		<title>Socrates on Man is the Measure of All Things</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a later dialogue, the Theaetetus, the authority of Protagoras is again challenged, this time as a result of the famous claim in his long-lost book, "Man is the measure of all things."

Socrates notes that if Protagoras claims that each man one at a time and for himself is the measure of truth, then why should we believe this or any other pronouncement?
<blockquote>I am charmed with his doctrine..but I wonder that he does not begin his book with a declaration that a pig or dog-faced baboon or some yet stranger monster which has sensation is the measure of all things; then might he have shown a magnificent contempt for or opinion of him by informing us at the outset that while we were revering him like a god for his wisdom, he was no better than a tadpole.</blockquote>
In so many words, Socrates insists that we can't have it both ways. Protagoras can't stand as a paragon of philosophical wisdom and still contend that everybody, one at a time, is the measure of all things.

At the end of the day, the problem of conduct is a problem of principle. If the principle is right, it is universally right. It is not tarnished or reduced by the mere showing that large numbers of people don't embrace.

Each man is not the measure of all things. There is a measure of things, and it is the task of the individual to find a way to understand that measure and apply it properly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To return to the story of Gyges, the point of the dialogue is not to examine what people will do if they were able to make themselves invisible. The point of philosophy is to determine how people ought to behave, not how they do behave.
<ol>
 	<li>Socrates recognizes that people are corporeal entities, inclined by pleasure and pain. He says that we might regard ourselves as charioteers, pulled by both a good horse and a bad horse.</li>
 	<li>The metaphor of the chariot and the good and bad steed is also found in the Katha Upanishads: "Know now the soul [atman] as riding in a chariot. He who lacks understanding, whose mind is not constantly held firm, his sense is uncontrolled, like the vicious horses of a chariot driver."</li>
 	<li>We see from India to Athens this useful metaphor of the impulses of the body being like an untamed steed, pulling us in one direction. Socrates recognizes that we must have a will capable of resolving itself to follow the right course of action.</li>
 	<li>The will itself cannot determine the right course of action, and desire knows only one course of action--that by virtue of which it fulfills itself. How, then, do we discover the right course of action? the answer is through the supremacy of reason, which in turn, is a reflection of our recognition that mathematical proportion, harmony, and balance must be the guides and the goals of life.</li>

		<title>Aristotle on the Knowable</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) begins the <em>Metaphysics</em> with the observation:" All men by nature desire to know. An example is the delight we take in our senses. For even quite apart from their usefulness, they are loved for their own sake, and no more than the sense of sight."

There is an essentially instinctive desire for knowledge common to all creatures, which is necessary if they are to survive. Aristotle is too much the natural scientist to dismiss the information gleaned by the senses.

Nature does nothing by chance, and we have obviously been fitted out with senses in order to be guided by them.

As an opening statement, the first sentences of the <em>Metaphysics</em> are a vindication of knowledge gleaned by perception. That this is incomplete there is to be no doubt, but if we are to engage the problem of knowledge, perception--a sensory awareness of the world around us--must be our starting point.
<ol>
 	<li>In his naturalistic works on animals, Aristotle assigns to perception many powers and functions we are inclinedÂ to subsume under such headings as "intelligence" or "cognition."</li>
 	<li>In doing so, he grants to the animal kingdom rich perceptual powers that go well beyond elementary sensory functions, but he will then deny the animal kingdom that culminating and defining rational power reserved Â to the human psyche.</li>
</ol>
This leads us to Aristotle's understanding of the various powers that the animal kingdom comes equipped with and a scheme of classification that will distinguish between and among animal types in terms of these powers or faculties.
<ol>
 	<li>Aristotle begins with the kind of question a scientist would ask when seeking a reasonable basis on which to divide the living from the inanimate realms. What is the fundamental power (dynamis) in virtue of which a living thing has life? What is it that the soulÂ (psyche) of an entity must posses by way of animation such that life itself becomes possible?</li>
 	<li>The basic powers are nutritive, reproductive, and locomotor (even some plants have the latter).</li>
 	<li>Animals are differentiated by having the power of sensation: the power of perception, of acting consciously in response to events in the external world.</li>
 	<li>These basic functions of nutrition, reproduction, locomotion, and sensation are all powers of the soul (psyche). As used by Aristotle, this word is a generic term for those processes that are life-giving and life-sustaining.</li>
 	<li>With more complex animal forms, to these powers of the soul is added some kind of intellectual or intelligent power: the power of problem solving. Aristotle grants this to much of the animal kingdom; they have that in common with us.</li>
</ol>
Aristotle reserves to human beings, however, a psychic power or faculty of a special kind. It is usually rendered in English as "reason," but the word he uses in his treatise <em>On the Soul</em> is <em>epistemonikon</em>, meaning the cognitive ability by which we comprehend universal propositions.
<ol>
 	<li>Epistemonikon is a special feature of rationality, fitting us uniquely for, among other things, the rule of law itself. After all, what is the rule of law except the ability to apply some universal precept to an indefinitely large number of individual instances, each qualifying as, for example, "theft?"</li>
 	<li>It is in virtue of this rationality that we become fit for a mode of political, social, and civic life that is unavailable to other "types" within the kingdom of life.</li>
</ol>
Given that we have these faculties and powers, how will Aristotle understand and approach the problem of knowledge? For Aristotle, to know something is essentially to know the cause of it; that is, to have a systematic, scientific understanding of things (<i>episteme</i>) is to know the causes by which things are brought about.

In effect, Aristotle says that a claim that someone knows that a right-angle triangle has 180 degrees can be understood in one of two ways.
<ol>
 	<li>A person may know that a triangle has 180 degrees because she has measured the angles and sees that their sum is 180 degrees, or she may know that by definition a triangle has 180 degrees and, thus, knows this of all triangles without measuring any of them.</li>
 	<li>What is the difference between the knowledge of one sort and the other? In one case, what is known is known by experience and does not rise to the level of episteme. In contrast, developed knowledge, such as could be gained by studying geometry, is a knowledge of the regulative principles and laws that govern the affairs of things, not simply factual knowledge of this or that.</li>
</ol>
Of course, to say that knowledge requires an understanding of the causes of things is to raise a question about just what a cause is. "Causation" can be understood in several senses.
<ol>
 	<li>Every identifiable thing that exists is made of some particular material and could not exist except as a result of that material. The marble of which a statue is made, is the material cause.</li>
 	<li>Every such thing is recognizable as a given type or form of thing. This "form," then , must be present for the thing to be what it is. In this respect, the shape of the statue and its resemblance to an original is its formal cause.</li>
 	<li>But form is imparted to matter by strokes and blows and other forms of mechanical influence. The shape of the statue is carved out of the stone by chisel and hammer; these are the efficient cause of the statue.</li>
 	<li>The ultimate understanding of the object stems from the intelligent design that the object itself realizes. Aristotle refers to this as the final cause--that is, the final thing realized in time, although it is first in conception.</li>
</ol>
Truly developed knowledge embraces not only the material, efficient, and formal causes, but the <em>that for the sake of which</em> these causes were recruited. To understand x is to know what x is for, what its purpose or end, its <em>telos</em>, is. Thus does Aristotle seek <em>teleological</em> explanations as ultimate.

Questions of what things are for are also central to Aristotle's ethical and political thought. We have purposes and ends as the kinds of beings we are; how are those to be reached? How does the polis aid or hinder those ends?
<ol>
 	<li>Our knowledge of ourselves must be grounded in a respect for just what our defining abilities achieve because these very abilities reveal the <em>that for the sake of which...</em></li>
 	<li>The developed knowledge that we have leads us to an understanding that the things of the universe, including living things, instantiate a plan; they fit in. Nature does not do things without a purpose. The ultimate question for understanding, then, is:"How does this fit into things? What is it for? What purpose does it serve?"</li>
 	<li>We know at the outset that nothing with pattern and design comes about accidentally. As Aristotle says, "If the art of shipbuilding were in the wood, we would have ships by nature." Wood, however, is the material cause of the ship, and the workers who build the ship are its efficient cause.</li>
 	<li>The art of shipbuilding is finally in the ship's designer. It is the designer who knows what ships are for and how that purpose is served by the right materials, rightly assembled. To "know" in this sense is to comprehend far more than anything conveyed by the mere material composition of an object.</li>
</ol>
As a final point, we must note one other aspect of Aristotle's philosophy of explanation that is often misunderstood.

Aristotle argues that a thoroughly scientific explanation is one that includes a universal principle of which the thing to be explained is an instance, something that is always the case. We do not fully understand any event unless we can show it to be an example of some universal principle of which it is an instance.

When Aristotle writes on biological subjects, as well as psychological and social matters, he inserts a qualifier: <em>hos epiÂ toÂ polu</em>, which is best rendered as "for the most part," "by and large," or "in general."

In other words, Aristotle teaches us to expect precision only to the extent that the subject at hand admits of it and to seek no more precision that what the subject at hand will admit of. When we examine complex social, political, and moral phenomena, we look for general precepts that are right by and large, in general, and for the most part.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do everything you do well. There is no one thing so trifling, but which (if it is to be done at all) ought to be done well... For instance, dress is a very foolish thing; and yet it is a very foolish thing for a man not to be well dressed, according to his rank and way of life; and it is so far from being a disparagement to any man's understanding, that it is rather a proof of it, to be well dressed as those whom he lives with: the difference in this case, between a man of sense and a fop, is, that fop values himself upon his dress; and the man of sense laughs at it, at the same time that he knows he must not neglect it. There are thousand foolish customs of this kind, which not being criminal must be compiled with, and even cheerfully, by men of sense. Diogenes the Cynic was a wise man for despising them, but a fool for showing it. Be wiser than other people, if you can; but do not tell them so.

		<title>Aristotle on Friendship</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=1170</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Man is, by nature, a social animal whose inclination it is to live in the company of others." "Man is, by nature, a political animal." These are two famous views of Aristotle: that we are by nature social and that we are by nature political; there seems to be something in us that compels us to live in society with others.

In light of Aristotle's approach to knowledge and understanding, we are not surprised that the question arising from this fact is: What are such groupings for?

Not only do we have a tendency to group ourselves together, but it also seems that we don't stop at the level of tribal enclaves or small familial ensembles. Whenever there are favoring circumstances, there seems to be a movement in the direction of forming a polis. This fact also raises an interesting question: Why should this tendency to live in the company of others ever move beyond the stage of families? What purpose is served by more complex modes of social and, ultimately, political life?

To this question we might answer, "There's safety in numbers," but we don't need a political community for defense. As Aristotle points out, pirates defend themselves, and indeed, pirates engage in trade; lawless communities can conduct both endeavors.

What, then, are the grounds of social affiliation, if not just self-defense, commerce, or utility? We begin our search for an answer in Aristotle's two major ethical writings, the Nichomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics.
<ol>
 	<li>The majority of scholars would probably regard the Nichomachean Ethics as Aristotle's developed position on matters ethical, although some controversy exists on this point.</li>
 	<li>In both works, Aristotle examines the nature of that most basic form of social affiliation, friendship. Aristotle's thoughts on friendship will prove to be a useful introduction to his understanding of social cohesion and political affiliation.</li>
</ol>
Friendship, says Aristotle, comes in different forms and serves different purposes.

Some friendships are grounded solely in considerations of sensual pleasure. Such pleasure is ephemeral, however, and the friendship lasts only as long as the pleasure is reciprocated and forthcoming.

Some friendships are based on utility. Two people befriend each other because they are useful to each other. Again, such friendships are not enduring. Other people may prove to be more useful to one of the friends, or the usefulness may no longer be reciprocated.

The third class of friendship is identified by Aristotle as <em>teleia philia</em>, usually translated as "completed" or "perfected" friendship.
<ol>
 	<li>This expression is intended to convey a species of friendship that expresses the end or purpose served by human associations; therefore, the grounding of this form of friendship is virtue itself.</li>
 	<li>In such friendships, the friends share a set of values and principles of an essentially and irreducibly moral nature.</li>
 	<li>In this kind of friendship, what one person wants for his friend is what is good for the friend for the friend's sake.</li>
 	<li>What we find in a friendship of this kind is a constructive relationship in which each friend, in virtue of his own qualities, helps to realize ever more fully what is not only potentially in the other but also realized in the other. These are friendships of a lifetime. They exist in virtue of the fact that they conduce to goodness, understood as moral excellence, or <em>arete</em>.</li>
</ol>
Aristotle argues that this kind of friendship is available not to the many but only toÂ <em>kaloiÂ kagathoi</em>, "gentlemen," what we might think of as chivalric knights. Further, virtuous or perfected friendship is possible only between those who are equal, though the measure of equality is not quantitative but proportional.
<ol>
 	<li>Sufficient equality exists between an audience Â and a performer because each grants to the other what is due.</li>
 	<li>The only degree of equality that would entirely negate the possibility of friendship would be that which divides humanity from the gods!</li>
</ol>
When we say that the possibility of a completed or perfected friendship is brought about as a result of the virtue that flourishes in the participants, the question naturally arises as to what we mean by virtue.

Virtue includes the intellectual abilities that are central to our human life--greatness in art, learning, leadership. These virtues are partly innate but largely learned from masters.

Moral virtue is also learned. Rather than being intuitive or residing in the soul of superior individuals, it is acquired by lifelong practice--the habit of virtue. It is the result of a lifetime of learning and practice and discipline toward the goal of doing right.

Moral virtue is a mean between excesses, a balance point. The goal of virtue is perfection, conceived of as just the proper relation of elements--the golden mean, the middle way.
<ol>
 	<li>Anger is natural; all men are endowed with it by nature, and nature does nothing by chance. What must be practiced in order to be virtuous is anger at the right objects: anger at injustice is proper.</li>
 	<li>Rage is not virtuous because it is excessive and uncontrolled. Courage is the virtue at the balance point between heedlessness and cowardice, which are both excessive forms of the same thing.</li>
</ol>
We return to the question of why we enter into political forms of social affiliation. We are, by nature, social animals whose inclination is to live in the company of others, but why the polis?

Aristotle makes a quite interesting claim in the Politics, that in the order of things, the polis precedes the family and the individual.
<ol>
 	<li>The polis does not precede the family in the sense of family as a breeding pool; it does not precede in the order of time. If all one means by family is a kind of hereditary relatedness, then of course, we can have that without any kind of political community.</li>
 	<li>What we mean by family, however, is a pattern of obligation and duties: the obligations that parents have to their children and children to their parents, the power to accumulate estates and pass on property through wills, to engage in familial modes of activity.</li>
 	<li>All this presupposes an essentially political form of life. Obligations and duties are brought about within the polis. Thus, to have a family in that developed sense of family, at least some minimal form of political life is necessary.</li>
</ol>
Again, to say that the polis precede the individual cannot refer to events in the order of time. But what do we mean by the individual?
<ol>
 	<li>If all we mean is the body, then obviously, one needs neither a polis nor a family for that.</li>
 	<li>We identify individuals with certain designations, however, which come about within an essentially political community. We define ourselves through certain tasks and responsibilities, obligations, duties, and contractual terms, such as terms of marriage.</li>
 	<li>These identifications of the individual, these things that give the individual a personal identity, are inextricably bound up with familial and political life.</li>
</ol>
Aristotle is recovering the Homeric idea that a flourishing life presupposes a political form of affiliation, a rich and familial form of life entered into by those who are prepared to live together at the level of principle and in friendly relationships, which themselves presuppose a commitment to virtue.

In the end, virtuous actions are those performed consciously by virtuous persons, but people of virtue form a minority. Those fit for virtuous or perfected friendship are also fit for rule.
<ol>
 	<li>Mob rule is the rule of passion and can tyrannize over the virtuous, because the tastes of the mob are generally grounded in considerations of pleasure and utility.</li>
 	<li>We find in Aristotle, although not to the same extent that we found in Plato, a certain suspicion about radical forms of democratic rule, a recognition that the <em>kaloi kagathoi</em> must be the leaders.</li>
 	<li>Perhaps the best mode of political life is a constitutional monarchy, where the rule of law is determinative, but where those who are in charge of administering that law function as friends.</li>
</ol>

		<title>Aristotle on the Perfect Life</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=1175</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We continue our examination of Aristotle's two ethical treatises, <em>Nichomachean Ethics</em> and<em> Eudemian Ethics</em>. In particular, we look at his understanding of the problem of conduct and conflicting solutions to it.

Virtue or excellence is of two distinguishable forms, the intellectual and the moral. The end of the intellectual virtues is knowledge of one sort or another, whereas the end of the moral virtues is the formation of character, or self-perfection. The intellectual virtues are the result of teaching and learning. The moral virtues arise from habit.

Chief among the intellectual virtues is scientific knowledge (<em>eptisteme</em>) by which one knows the causes of things and the laws that govern them. Art (<em>techne</em>), too, is an intellectual virtue by which various things are created.

Practical reason (<em>phronesis</em>) is yet another intellectual virtue, by which one comes to distinguish what is good and bad, the prudent course of action, the right strategy for securing safety and prosperity, and so on.

The right kind of life also finds us committing ourselves, committing our rational powers, to what is worth thinking about. Given a choice between contemplating issues of philosophical consequence and contemplating changes in Â the stock market, a more flourishing life is lived by those who contemplate the former rather than the latter.

Moral excellence is developed through habitual striving and a devotion to self-perfection, but why aspire to moral excellence at all? Why should one be courageous as opposed to being a coward? Why should one be temperate as opposed to being extreme?

To answer these questions, we must return to Aristotle's theory of causation.

Aristotle transforms the question "Why should I live a virtuous life?" to the more general question "Why do I do anything? Why do I do things that involve a deliberated choice between two alternatives?"

For Aristotle, the ultimate answer, after the question has been reduced further and further, is that we perform actions for the sake of <em>eudaimonia</em>. This central term is a challenge to translate.
<ol>
 	<li>In many translations, <em>eudaimonia</em> is "happiness." Everything that we do, we do for the sake of happiness, but this is not merely sensuous pleasure and the avoidance of pain.</li>
 	<li>The best understanding of <em>eudaimonia</em> is not that it's some point reached; it's not some transient state, but a veritable form or mode of life. It's life of a certain character and stripe, properly described as a flourishing life--<em>eudaimonia</em> is flourishing.</li>
 	<li>The goal of our deliberated courses of action is a flourishing life.</li>
</ol>
The problem of conduct is then translated into the question of how to achieve that flourishing life that is the ultimate end of our choices and actions. If the goal of all our actions, ultimately, is <em>eudaimonia</em>, then what is <em>eudaimonia</em> for us? Aristotle give two rather incompatible answers.

The essence of our nature is to reason; therefore, as birds must fly and fish must swim, it follows that the most complete life for humans is the life of contemplation of things of first importance and greatest excellence.

Actions performed for their own sake rather than as instrumentally tied to other goods are "godlike," because the Olympians do not act out of necessity. Only the contemplative life is "godlike" in this sense and answers to this description. The contemplation of the sublime is not a practical matter; it is not done in order to achieve some other good, such as wealth or fame or the like.

But is the contemplative life enough? Does not <em>eudaimonia</em> refer to a form of life that includes others? As a social animal, man cannot flourish in isolation.
<ol>
 	<li>Indeed, Aristotle says that the completed human being is found within the polis, at the hearth, and obedient to the law, not in Homer's heartless, stateless, lawless man.</li>
 	<li>It is in the nature of the completed being to seek out the company of equals and enter into enduring friendships, which by their nature, are founded in principles of pleasure, utility, and virtue.</li>
 	<li>The principles of virtue at the individual level are like the principles of law that govern the political community itself. The good state will require all of us to do what the rational man does by choice and, by enforcement, will make virtue habitual.</li>
 	<li>In guiding us toward virtuous conduct, the state renders us fitter, not merely for life in the polis, but for the most rewarding of friendships and the flourishing life that becomes possible thereby.</li>
</ol>
What would be the best form of life one could live, understood in these terms? The <em>eudaimonic</em> life would be the active life of the lawgiver. It would be the life of one immersed in the political needs and realities of his time and contributing to the polis through his own virtuous conduct, contributing in such a way that the state, like the person, perfects itself.
<ol>
 	<li>The purpose of the law is to secure a reasonable, prudent, harmonious form of life.</li>
 	<li>The rule of law attracts us, and we attach our fidelity to it, because it has a friendly quality--<em>philikon</em>. It inclines us to behave in ways that are best for us for our own sake.</li>
</ol>
How do we broker the seemingly competing claims of a life of political activity and the contemplative life?
<ol>
 	<li>The answer is that it may not be possible to reconcile these competing claims; even Aristotle offers us no compromise here.</li>
 	<li>There is a fundamental tension between a life of activity and a life of contemplation. Once a scholar decides to devote himself or herself to a life of study, which includes the recognition that by nature we are fallible beings, it becomes impossible to take decisive action at the daily political level.</li>
 	<li>In contrast, the political leader changes the world, with military force, enacted legislation, trade agreements, and so on.</li>
</ol>
In this view, who do we see on the horizon? Alexander the Great who attempted to Hellenize the world. In the process, he also transformed himself, illustrating the dilemma faced by those who seek to balance the contemplative life with the life of political affairs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a line too thin separating beingÂ in the world and being off the world. And even the saint can not help but cross it, if only to see the other life in perspective.

There is a fundamental tension between a life of activity and a life of contemplation, even granting that contemplation is itself aÂ kind of activity. There isn't any way around it at all.

Once a scholar decides to devote himself or herself to a life of study, trying to get things right, and recognizing that by nature we are fallible beings, it becomes impossible to take decisive action at the daily political level of decision making, industrial, corporate, bureaucratic life.

Do I support this government policy?
What do I say about neighbor's loud music and chemical long?
After all, on a certain construe, well if you look at it this way, well if you interpret it through the eyes of the...

This is the Hamletian life, that is the life of the disinterested scholar, the philosophically inclined person who recognizes that error stalks our most cherished theories.

The contemplative life really, as the hindus andÂ buddhists recognize, is a contemplative life. But it is a life that by its very nature must remove one from day to day affairs of the world. The life of Pericles, the life of any great political leader, any great lawgiver, is a life not just of activity. Of course, Aristotle understands contemplation is activity, is not a trans-state. But the political leader is changing the world, andÂ often changing it with his hands. He's changing the world with military force, with currency, with enacted legislation that carries heavy penalties for defiance, trade agreements, rhetoric, propaganda, the marshaling of resources of the community, threats, praises, artifices of one sort or another, recruiting dramatists and musicians, painters and sculptors so that art can be used forÂ rhetorical purposes, great things can thus be brought about.

So who's on the horizon as we weigh these possibilities?

All of the resources of the Hellenistic world are going to be pulled together by whom? Not by a philosopher, but by Alexander the Great, and deployed for the express purpose of Hellenizing the world.

This is a leader that Aristotle had an opportunity to teach in his youth.Â Now as Alexander the Great, he presents the man of practical affairs. How do we Hellenize the world? Well, we do it every way we can, including having all of our soldiers marry Persian women. At last, by the time Alexander the Great came back from his conquests, he is found wearing Persian head dress, quasi-devine regalia, replete with crown, as the Athenians giggle in the street. So he certainly Hellenized much of the world, but he also transformed himself to a considerable extent.

That's the man of practical affairs. And that's the dilemma faced by all who weigh the choices between the contemplation of first things and making the world conform to one's best judgements.

		<title>Roman Law - Making a City of the Once-Wide World</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Justinian's Institutes, or elements of law, provide a 6th-century consideration of juridical principles developed by Roman lawyers over the course of centuries.
<ol>
 	<li>The Institutes, which are the work of Tribonian and his colleagues commissioned by Justinian, begin with this statement:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>The law of nature is the law instilled by nature in all creatures. It is not merely for mankind but for all creatures of the sky, earth and sea... All peoples with laws and customs apply law which is partly theirs alone and partly shared by all mankind... The law which natural reason makes for all mankind... is called "the law of all peoples" [ius gentium].</blockquote>
2. Could Stoicism have said it better? What is taken for granted is that nature does nothing without a purpose, that there is an order and reasonableness to the world, and that human affairs are to be governed by the same rationality.

Consider what is meant in the Institutes by nature fitting out all creatures with law.
<ol>
 	<li>The animal kingdom does instinctually what is required for its own survival and flourishing. So, too, are peoples fitted out by nature with certain intuitive understandings essential to a life that will be flourishing, coherent, and culturally continuing.</li>
 	<li>And how does nature do this? By making us aware at the most fundamental and intuitive level of core precepts of equity.</li>
</ol>
The <em>iusÂ gentium</em> is a unifying principle capable of smoothing out the differences of culture and custom and providing at least the possibility of a shared civic life. What is the status of the <em>ius gentium</em> in the multicultural world of the 21th century?

What Roman law reduced to written form was understood to reach all who qualify as rational beings, and the Roman Empire was about as "multicultural" as any nation in the history of the world.

The ancient world, for all its elitism, recognized a fundamental, unifying force according to which we have a shared psychology, a shared spirituality, and a common humanity. The law in its developed form must appeal to that.

Find a creature that cannot be appealed to at that level, and the best explanation is not that the creature is the product of a different culture, but that the creature is incomplete in its humanity, outside the natural order of humanity.

In contrast, find a mature, healthy adult anywhere in the world, and that person, in virtue of his or her rationality, will recognize certain precepts as unchallengeable. Were the world otherwise, it would be impossible even to engage in trade or to explain why punishment is imposed for certain transgressions or why rewards are given.

The cultural variations we observe are not merely artificial entries that obscure what is, indeed, homogeneity. No, there is great heterogeneity from culture to culture. Rome was persuaded, however, that such heterogeneity did not extend to the level of rationality itself; therefore, all people, wherever they were from, whatever they believed, and whatever their customary practices were, were fit for the rule of law and could be brought up to be worthy of the rule of law.

After the Goths had sacked Rome, a number of Romans came back to their defeated city to see what was left. One of these men, Rutilius Namatianus, wrote these lines about Rome:
<blockquote>Thou has made of alien realms one fatherland. The lawless found their gain beneath thy sway. Sharing thy laws with them, thou hast subdued, thou hast made a city of the once-wide world.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By the 11th and 12th centuries, the East and the West were divided into two intellectually warring camps, with two different conceptions of human nature and its purposes and two different conceptions of truth at the most fundamental religious level. Each camp used classical philosophy as a means of validation.

Here arises a wonderfully rich interpretative exercise as to what Aristotle really meant, what Plato really meant, whether something can be known as a result of prophetic insights or by experience or by reason alone, and so on.

At this point in both cultures, philosophical positions may come to be judged as heresies. Once we begin to use philosophy as a way of vindicating or verifying what is essentially a religious position, the wrong interpretation may qualify as an offense against the religion.

It should come as no surprise that as the Christian church solidified its own position politically, economically, and socially, it found itself doing constant battle with heresies. Why is this sequence of events perhaps inevitable?
<ol>
 	<li>A religion solidifies its position by developing an official canon. This now becomes a body of knowledge that can be taught to the faithful, and the faithful are understood to be those who are prepared to be obedient to this teaching.</li>
 	<li>But once positions become solidified and burdens are imposed on those who are not prepared to accept their validity, the philosophical program stalls.</li>
 	<li>Thus, as the writers and thinkers in the Christian world begin to take on the challenges that come from the East and, as a result of those challenges, work out an ever clearer version of the canon, debates break out within the Christian community.</li>
 	<li>As we will see in a later lecture on the witch panics, certain forms of conduct now take on a new color. Disorders and diseases of a certain kind suggest mysterious, even sinister, causes. As mentioned earlier, this was not the case in the Islamic East.</li>
</ol>
The tension between Islam and Christianity, coupled with the recovery of ancient Greek thought, would cause a fruitful resumption of the "long debate."
<ol>
 	<li>The "long debate" is the debate about knowledge, conduct, and governance, which had animated the earliest philosophical inquiries into the nature of things.</li>
 	<li>The debate had been discontinued by the need of Christianity to solidify its religious position.</li>
 	<li>The greatest opponent of debate is orthodoxy, and Christian orthodoxy arises out of several core concepts: the old anti-intellectualism the church fathers, the social ambitions of the church to build and run a new society, and the Augustinian conception that while reason has its use, faith is paramount.</li>
 	<li>The combination of these elements resulted in a degree of fundamentalist conviction that was hostile to debate. If not a heresy, debate is at least an insult to the faithful and the faith.</li>
 	<li>The contribution of Islamic culture was to show the West that there is more than one book of truth and more than one set of prophecies, more than one language used to express thanks to God, and more than one culture that might ground a spiritual life.</li>
</ol>
When the long debate is resumed, the question again is whether the best route to truth is by reason, intuition, faith, or naturalistic observation. The same question may be asked regarding ethical and moral issues. Again, the seeds of heresy and skepticism are planted, the inevitable products of authentic and disinterested inquiry.

The pressures against sustaining the long debate are always great, but the contemplative life that the Koran requires of the faithful is entirely compatible with the sustained inquiry. Indeed, the Islamic commitment to analysis and debate would make possible much of the philosophical program of the Scholastic Age in Western civilization.

		<title>Gothic Cathedrals And Human Freedom</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=1217</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another of the great achievements of the period rather derisively referred to as "medieval" is the Gothic cathedral, more than 100 of which were erected in Europe and Britain between 1150 and 1300.

These extraordinary creations of technology differ from the art of the Renaissance in a central way: Where even the smallest work of the Renaissance was signed, the huge cathedrals are, effectively, anonymous.

The cathedral and its glass windows reflect the medieval worldview: earthly life as metaphor.
<ol>
 	<li>The medieval world is grounded in the idea of harmony and cyclical recurrences, not progress.</li>
 	<li>For example, the serf served the lord of the manor as that lord served the Lord of all. In this sense, subservience need not be denigrating but is part of a divine plan.</li>
 	<li>Serfs, it should be noted, had rights, including the right to bring their lords to court for abuse. The lord of the manor, in turn, had his special duties, as did clergy, the knights errant, and so on. The message to all was that the faithful servant's task is to preserve that good order and to promote what is most worthy within it for the greater glory of God.</li>
</ol>
The 19th-century aesthete who helped restore respect for the Gothic was John Ruskin. In <em>The Stones of Venice</em>, he writes that late-Renaissance architecture, with its line and angle precision, lacks human freedom. The Gothic, on the other hand, with all its ostensible imperfections and mythic absurdities, is a full expression of the free imagination in devotional commitment to the divine.

The Gothic cathedral is a rhetorical statement; it's a statement that at once captures mystery, truth, power, scale, proportion, beauty, ambiguity. Does it make us feel small? Yes, but only in relation to the divine.

		<title>Chivalry</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The third great institutional creation of the medieval period was chivalry, a symbology that expresses faith, devotion, purity, and a longing for the unattainable.

The word chivalry brings to mind the knight-errant with his preposterous manners, as well as those incredible jousting matches where otherwise intelligent men mount horses and kill each other in the interest of gaining love. What was the point of all this, and how did it bear on what we have called the problem of conduct?

First, it is important to identify the chivalric knight as, essentially, a "secular priest." He is the executive branch of a government, at the top of which is the church itself, the repository of that rational and divine template that should govern the work of the world.
<ol>
 	<li>Right reason is the reason of the church because it is directly inspired by God. And the reason of God must now press itself through a willful, faithful, and "iconic" medium, who is the knight-errant.</li>
 	<li>In this, we have the arrangement of what Plato argued was the nature of human nature: a soul, the tripartite elements of which are the rational, the passionate, the volitional. It is also akin to the Holy Trinity, a unity within diversity.</li>
 	<li>The knight's code features ritualized self-sacrifice as a form of nobility. His politeness symbolizes his strength, for he is reserved and retreating by choice. he has complete control of his emotions, which is why Â he can serve any one of the causes of justice. The only insult is an insult to honor.</li>
</ol>
Chivalry is one of the great civilizing influences in the history of Western civilization. It could be given to certain excesses and lend itself to comic renditions, but in this institution, we find the incorporation of some of the most deeply held precepts of classical philosophy and the Christian ethic.

		<title>The Reappearance of Experimental Science</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=1222</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first half of the 13th century also hosted a revival of experimental science.

By way of background, we should note that secondary sources routinely highlight the achievements in abstract philosophy of the ancient world at the expense of its scientific achievements.
<ol>
 	<li>As we've seen, the ancients made a number of contributions in medicine, biology, physics, astronomy, and so on.</li>
 	<li>Further, thanks to Islamic commentaries on Hellenic texts, the West began to recover the natural science works of Aristotle and see in the the possibility for progressive knowledge.</li>
</ol>
Two figures of immense importance are found at the University of Oxford, both members of the Catholic clergy and both among the most instructed minds of their century. First, in Robert Grosseteste (1175-1253), bishop of Lincoln, we find a scholar as much at home with optics as with theology. Grosseteste studies and wrote on Aristotle's ethical treatises, as well as the <em>Physics</em>. By the time of his death, he had created at Oxford an interest in what his student Roger Bacon would come to call <em>experimental science</em>.

Roger Bacon and the late-Scholastic dons of Oxford would lay the foundations of the fruitful controversies and new methods of the 16th and 17th century modern scientific movement.
<ol>
 	<li>Scholasticism was an attempt to rationalize the teachings of the church. Doctrinal decrees in the 13th century left no doubt but that God had created the universe out of nothingness and that, as an expression of the divine mind, this same universe was ordered in a rational manner. Both of these doctrines were an invitation to forms of inquiry that would evolve into experimentation.</li>
 	<li>The further understanding, reinforced by the works of Thomas Aquinas, is that Christian faith and the facts of science can't be in conflict, because both reach truths about the same creation. One might need some sort of algorithm or translation device to get from one to the other, but there is no fundamental tension between the perspective of the natural philosopher or the natural scientist and the perspective of the theological or religious person.</li>
 	<li>The Scholastics also owed a debt to Augustine and some of the early church fathers in the assertion that we have an obligation to know God and that the way to do so is by his works. Thus, Scholastic scholarship recognizes the central place of scientific inquiry in a life of faith.</li>
</ol>
Experimental science also engages us in applying our senses to God's creation and integrating the evidence of the sense into a more rational framework. As Bacon says in his <em>Opus Maius</em>:" I now wish to unfold the principles of experimental science, since without experience nothing can be sufficiently known."
<ol>
 	<li>Absent direct, sensory commerce with the physical world, knowledge is empty. Bacon goes on to say:
For there are two modes of acquiring knowledge, namely, by reasoning and experience. Reasoning draws the conclusion, and makes us grant the conclusion, but does not make the conclusion certain, nor does it remove doubt so that the mind may rest on the intuition of truth, unless the mind discovers it by the path of experience.</li>
 	<li>Bacon understands that we are equipped with two modes of knowing and that the problem of knowledge must be addressed via two paths: One cannot know anything merely by fashioning abstract, rational depictions of what it might be. What must be combined with rationality is knowledge gleaned by the senses. By the same token, experience must be disciplined and ordered, and this is what "experimentation" achieves.</li>
 	<li>The actual experiments conducted by Roger Bacon and hisÂ colleagues are interesting, but more important were his thoughts on what he called "the sin of ignorance" and the need for the clergy to be scientifically informed.</li>
 	<li>Experimental science, in the hands of Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon, becomes part of the ethics of Christian life. It's not a depreciation of the world to examine it at the sensory level, but it would be a depreciation to leave it there.</li>
</ol>
The great medieval Christian philosopher Duns Scotus put the case in yet another way:

As for what is known by experience, I have this to say. Even though a person dos not experience every single individual, but only a great many, nor does he experience them at all times, but only frequently, still he knows infallibly that it is always this way, and holds for all instances.
<ol>
 	<li>In other words, once we have sampled a number of cases and have seen how things work out in general, then we can lay claim, by local inference, to understanding how an individual instance will work under all circumstances.</li>
 	<li>Moreover, Duns Scotus knows this method of inquiry intuitively, in virtue of something "reposing in his soul."</li>
</ol>
Duns Scotus, Robert Grosseteste, and Roger Bacon are defending a mode of thought in the Scholastic period that is "characteristic" of that period, though also original and groundbreaking. This is not an age hostile to the senses, indifferent to experimental modes of inquiry; there's nothing dark about this period at all. Indeed, the labors of medieval scholarship, particularly in the context of the university--the corpus of Scholastic teaching, methodology, criticism, and analysis--will revive the noblest traditions of the West.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[... So again, this is notÂ an age hostile to the senses, indifferent to experimental modes of inquiry. There is nothing dark about this period at all. It's an age of great intellectual energy, which seems to some extent rather innocent and remote. Because it really is restoring something briefly misplaced.

If Greek philosophy has two long late fallow, if scholars in the West haveÂ not yetÂ recovered the habitual and sure-handed use of ancient intellectual resources, there is now at least the beginning of a full recovery.

The labors of medieval scholarship, particularly withinÂ the context of the university, the corpusÂ of Scholastic teaching and Scholastic thought, methodology, criticism, and analysis--will revive the noblest traditions of the West.

Every age is fairly confident that its respective is the modern perspective. Modern here is not simply the most recent word, however. And it certainly isn't the last word. All of the witch hunters were using the best evidence.Â They were using refined legal procedures, refined rules of evidence, right kinds of tests etc. TheyÂ were hunting witches.

So we are alwaysÂ confident in our science, quite confident in our religion, andÂ our philosophy, which is why I generally end aÂ lecture ofÂ this sort byÂ saying that:

When your confidence has reached a really high level in theseÂ regards, particularly everything that can be learned experimentally and by reason, by direct observation, by analyticity, by linguistic analysis, by a consultation with cultural historians and anthropologists so that you are absolutely certain you got the thing nail down,Â then what I would urge as a therapy is to move in front of aÂ mirror and say:
<blockquote>I may be wrong. I may be gravely wrong.Â I may be hopelessly, irretrievably wrong.</blockquote>
And in that, you may very well be right.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Aquinas's deep respect for Aristotle has him invariably referring to Aristotle as simply "the Philosopher," but Aquinas's reliance on Aristotle must be seen in light of his commitment to service in the church.

What Aquinas is attempting to get right is the spiritual dimension of human life, the obligations that we have to God, to conduct our lives in such a way as to be worthy of the salvation that was secured through the death of Jesus Christ.

He certainly is not going to settle for the philosophical musings--no matter how penetrating they might be--of a pagan philosopher who died in the 4th century B.C. To make the point briefly, we should not read Thomistic philosophy as a gloss on Aristotelianism.

Aristotle is important to Aquinas, however, because he understood the utterly integrated nature of those factors participating in the realization or the stultification of our humanity: the political world in which we find ourselves, the disciplining influences of law, the importance of early instruction, the sources of self-corruption.

This helps explain why, when Aquinas considers Aristotle's treatment of the virtues, he concludes that the account ignores the foundational theological virtues. <em>Episteme</em> is the means by which we comprehend the affairs of the world, but this intellectual virtual cannot help us reach the divine essence.

Further, to the intellectual virtues of Aristotle must be added the theological virtues infused in us by God: faith, hope, and charity.
<ol>
 	<li>What would Aristotle make of charity? He describes magnanimity as a virtue: Not only should we be virtuous, but we should be virtuous in a large-hearted and generous way, not grudgingly. This is as close as Aristotle comes to charity.</li>
 	<li>Christian charity, in contrast, is not putting oneself forward but sharing what one has, not taking for oneself even what one deserves if another is in need. Absent this theological virtue, the Christian cannot know salvation.</li>
 	<li><em>Faith</em>, as Aquinas means it, would be almost repugnant to Aristotle. If the word refers to a superstitious rejection of the evidence of sense and the counsels of reason, it cannot be a virtue.</li>
 	<li>On the Thomistic account, if our duty is to know the divine essence, we must recognize that rationality and the evidence of the senses will take us in that direction but can never help us achieve the goal completely. There are mysteries in creation that only faith can reach, most importantly, God's offer of salvation.</li>
</ol>
The problem of conduct for Aquinas is the problem of reconciling us to the eternal law. It is the path to or away from salvation and eternal happiness.

Right conduct is not simply a matter of making sure one's life in the political community is a decent one, that one is civically responsible, and so on. The problem of conduct now is inextricably bound up with notions of a life that is committed to knowing God, to loving God, and to becoming worthy of God's presence in the life to come.

In this undertaking, the rule of law guides and serves. Defined by Aquinas as "an ordinance of reason promulgated by one who has responsibility for the good of the community," law appeals to the rational side of our nature. The Thomistic theory of law is a natural law theory, much in the sense that Aristotle, Cicero, and the Roman law itself understood the relationship: Law is "natural" to creatures of a certain kind.

In the thrall of addiction to our own desires and their satisfaction, we neglect those basic goods by which a flourishing and worthy life is served.

How do we protect against ourselves in this regard? Apart from the gift of grace and the blessings of heaven, there are more immediately perceptible means of improvement and immunity: the well-ordered state and the realm of justice.

Taking human nature to be an expression of divine love, Aquinas finds the children of God placed here for a purpose. That purpose is for what is best in us to flourish, and what is best in us is the capacity for an integrated, wholesome family life; for responsibilities to the church; to conduct ourselves in a prudent manner; to desire the good and the to shun evil; and to shun what cannot be in the interest of a rational being.

We do have the potentiality for developing the moral and intellectual virtues by study and contemplation. We must also deploy, finally, the theological virtues so that the form of life we live matches up in a proper way with the life that Jesus lived.

Stepping out of the context of religion, we find in Thomas Aquinas a towering intellect, yet toward the end of his life, he turned away from scholarship. He thought so deeply and persistently on the meaning of life that he came to find words incapable of expressing truths that can only be known by the grace of God.

		<title>Let Us Burn the Witches to Save Them</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Natural magic, natural science, and the witch panics from a rich and ominous mixture in the age we revere with the title "Renaissance." Here is an age when theory and imagination, fortified by revelation and high-stakes politics, yield much of the best and the worst in us all.

As a preoccupation of sorts throughout Europe and the British Isles from 1400 to 1700 (and later), the prosecution and execution of witches would be justified by Scripture, by moral philosophy, and by science. The theoretical grounding of the practice was firm and carefully worked out and was adopted by some of the best minds of the ages in which the practice was common. A review of this episode in Western history reveals the purposes to which great philosophical ideas might be put.

...

By this time, formal trial procedures for witchcraft had already been rediscovered, replacing medieval tests of trial and ordeal. The 13th-century European courts, both secular and ecclesiastical, were in full possession of Roman legal procedure.

One of the benefits of the recovery and dissemination of Roman law was the replacement of the <em>accusatorial</em> scheme with an <em>inquisitorial</em> procedure, but this proved to be a mixed blessing.
<ol>
 	<li>Before the recovery and the reapplication of developed Roman law, complaints between parties were generally in the form of accusations. The accuser must make his case against the accused or himself face multiple penalties.</li>
 	<li>In the medieval period, the way some of the more serious charges were judged was Â through trial, ordeal, and compurgation. A defendant could choose between trial by jury or by God. In the latter case, under the supervision of the coroner, the defendant based barefoot over burning coals, or carried white-hot metal by hand, or was tested in scalding water for burns.</li>
 	<li>Compurgation was based on a different principle. Here, the defendant was required to summon a fixed number of persons willing to swear before God that they believed the defendant's oath of innocence. The outcome depended as much on the faithful performance of the required procedures as the credibility of the compurgators. This mode of trial, however, was not available for those charged with witchcraft.</li>
 	<li>On the whole, the inquisitorial procedure was an advance in adjudication. Through it, the authorities did not have to wait for a complaint but could bring an action, engage in an inquisition, compile evidence, take testimony, and order the appropriate remedies. Properly applied, the inquisitorial procedure functioned much like a grand jury in our system of law.</li>
 	<li>This system worked toÂ the disadvantage of those tried for witchcraft, because now the accuser did not have to face the accused. The inquisitor could bring the charge, never divulging the names of those who made the accusation.</li>
 	<li>Torture was permitted, but no confession made in the torture chamber would count as evidence against the witch. Rather, a period of time had to elapse, two or three days, and the same admission would have to be made in open court. Torture typically was not needed, however, because many of those charged with witchcraft, typically older, eccentric women, actually admitted to the charges!</li>
</ol>
The number of executions cited in the literature ranges from hundreds of thousands to a million and upwards. Witches could offer very little by way of self-defense in these actions, and their execution would have had the necessary chilling effect on the community. The church authorities knew that it was far more important to save the soul than to preserve the body, and if burning the witch is a means to salvation, then in the flames one will find redemption.

What kind of evidence was relevant in a trial for witchcraft? The offenses themselves were not enough, because such outcomes could arise from accident or from uncomplicated criminal motives. It was not sufficient that someone had accused another of witchery. Substantial and incriminating evidence was required.
<ol>
 	<li>First, the courts required a document aimed at dealing with these difficult cases, a text that spelled out the salient characteristics of the witch and how these are to be uncovered. Such information would allow trial procedures, evidence, and sentencing to be applied in an even-handed way.</li>
 	<li>The book was the Malleus Maleficarum. The authors were two Dominicans, and the pope put his seal of approval on it, as did the kings and princes of Europe. The Malleus reached a prominence comparable to that of the Bible itself over the course of its numerous printings.</li>
 	<li>The text tells us without a doubt that witches exist and that anyone who expresses skepticism toward the concept is a heretic.</li>
 	<li>On the matter of evidence, it is sufficient to note that the witch has entered into a pact with the devil and, thus, has lost the capacity for remorse.</li>
</ol>
In all this, we see how easily a wrong-headed theory can wreak misery and shame on its victims. The lesson we learn is to choose our theories carefully.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Words are but the images of matter... To fall in love with them is all one as to fall in love with a picture.</blockquote>
-- Francis Bacon

So the complaint is not with the ancient world. The complaint is what has interceded between theÂ good startÂ of the ancient world made and then what Western intellectual history did with it, which wasÂ pretty much replace it with a collection of orthodoxies, ultra rationalistic, scholastic, logic chopping, analytical devices that found us falling in love with words.

He says in one of theÂ famous passages that this is like falling in love with a picture. Words are simply representative of things inÂ the external world. For goodness' sake, if you are interested in the external world, go into that world. Don't sit around, talking about it the way the lover falls in love with a picture.

So progress requires the right kind of method. The right kind of method was known toÂ antiquity. The intervening centuries have allowed us to imposeÂ the kind of official blindness on ourselves, and ignorance on ourselves, by way of orthodoxies.

What we now have to do is come to grapes with the secular dimensions of knowledge and the secular dimensions of progress. That all this will spawn yet other orthodoxies seems not to have worried Bacon as much as it might have.

		<title>Rene Descartes and the Authority of Reason</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=1281</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Good sense is of all things in the world the most equally distributed, for everybody thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that even those most difficult to please...do not commonly desire more than they already process...The power of forming a good judgement and of distinguishing the true from the false..is by nature equal in all men...(But) to be processed of good mental powers is not sufficient; the principle matter is to apply them well."

Ah, the diversity of opinions, and the constant tendency toward error ariseÂ not from unequal or insufficient rational power, but from faulting method of inquiry and discovery.

It is the purpose ofÂ the discourse on methods to reveal how Descartes himself hasÂ fashioned a mode of inquiry designed to save himself from such errors. As he says, he is not proposing something that all mustÂ follow. Rather, as something of an intellectual autobiography, he will share with readers, what has worked for one man, who just happens to be Rene Descartes. Well, this would be as if Alert Einstein wrote a treatise on how to think about problems of Physics and then noted that well, you know, it is just my way of doing it. There oughtÂ to be sure any number of candidate methods available and Descartes summaries them.

He is aÂ student of the history of ideas. He knows what's been tried before. His most lustrous contemporaries are products of intellectual history and largely so faithful to the ancients as to be addicted to ancient conclusions. The problem with history as a guide is that a man who spends too much time in a distant land becomes a stranger in his own country, says Descartes. The problem with the studying of history is that it simply removes one from the very context in which the insistent demands for knowledge are indeedÂ most insistent. History is a guide, but it is not an answer. No two historical events are ever precisely the same anyway such that all that one could glean from that kind of inquiry would be generality subject to interpretation and indeed, endless disagreement.

What about wanted philosophy? Could there be a better method than the philosophical method? Of course, philosophy doesn't have a single method. And in any case, if you consult the great philosophers of history, the salient fact that emerges is that they scarcely agree with each other on any major point. So indeed if philosophy were a reliable guide to the truth, the long debate would have been concluded a long time ago.

Now what about mathematics, the queen of the sciences? Now, at least, Descartes is a great mathematician. At least when a problem is solved mathematically, youÂ know it. Unfortunately, those problems are at a level of abstraction so removed from the facts of the physical world and our place in it that it's not entirely clear you really can match them up with reality at all. There isn't anything wrong with mathematics. But in a certain sense, there also isn't anything right about it as a method of inquiry. It's majestic as a method of analysis, and an abstract method of representation, but at last, not as a method of discovery.

For Descartes, these limitations lead to a different approach. For him, the right method begins with an utterly skeptical disposition. The right method should begin with a profession of ignorance. Not only don't I know anything, but I am positioned in such a way that what I think I know is probably latentÂ with error, misapprehension and confusion. So it's with this orientation that one committed to accepting nothing unless it can prevail on me as an idea of such power and clarity and indubitability that I am simply powerless to doubt it. This is how Descartes wants to precede. Descartes adopts the highest standard that must be met by anything presented as an object of knowledge. Anything that fails to satisfy that standard he says he is prepared to reject.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the century following his death, Newton had the status of a veritable icon. The major architects of reform and revolution in the Enlightenment routinely defended their ideas by way of "Newtonian" science and its implications.

In these respects, Newton is really the central figure in a veritable movement, a 17th-century movement that will stand as the first great age of science in the modern world. It is the age of Newton, Boyle, Galileo, Descartes, Wren, Huygens; the age in which the Royal Society is founded--"on the words of no man" is the motto--the age in which tradition, Scripture, rank and power are all putÂ on notice as science is found to be, at once, the engine of progress and the ultimate arbiter on matters of truth.

Newton's <em>Regulae</em>--his "rules" of philosophizing--establish the official relationship among conjecture, observation, experiment, and theory. Newton's great achievements leave no doubt but that natural philosophy has the intellectual resources with which to both explain and change the world.

...

Newton is an icon himself but also representative of an age caught up in the "romance of science." The 17th century was a busy commercial age, engaged in worldwide trade, which generated technical problems ranging from currency to ship-building that would look to science for answers.

The Royal Society (1660) became the center of a growing culture of science.
<ol>
 	<li>It was devoted to useful knowledge and opposed to the authority of any single person.</li>
 	<li>It became the repository of the world's clearest scientific thinking. Its members were enlisted to look into rumors of strange occurrences and monstrous births that once the clergy would have looked into, as well as to solve problems of commerce, economy, politics, and society.</li>
 	<li>Newton was one of the Royal Society's presidents, adding luster to a congress of inquiring minds that would come to include the greatest figures in the modern history of science, such as Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle, Â Christian Huygens, and Christopher Wren.</li>
</ol>
The "Age of Newton" launched the age of science. By the 18th century, the authority of science was widely accepted, and when dilemmas of social organization, morals, health, commerce, or industry arose, scientists would be called on to resolve them.

The age of Newton is a new chapter in the history of ideas; it is an age that establishes the scientific worldview as authoritative and science as the engine of progress.

We are indubitably the children of that age; faced with problems of any kind, we turn to scientists to solve them. We have inherited the ethos that no problem is real unless it admits of a solution reached by some specialized mode of attack, and any bona fide problem is soluble by some formulaic method or measurement. It is the age of Newton--the scientific worldview--that has shaped and guided this perspective.

Conversely, according to the ancient Greek thinkers, some problems are simply intrinsic to the very life and nature of humanity. The right task is not to look for a solution but to look around for an accommodation. This possibility is sometimes obscured by the success of science.

		<title>Hobbes and the Social Machine</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) flourished in the age of Bacon, Galileo, and Newton, and the implications of the age were not lost on him. If all of physics and mechanics could be reduced to systematic laws, it would be strange indeed if society could not be. Loose thinking, absurd confusions between material and immaterial, actual and metaphorical, must be swept away in order to do this work.

Hobbes's Leviathan is a work of social engineering: The overall plan of this uneven but ultimately influential work was to devise a system for averting civil strife by understanding the purpose of the state and the nature of those living in it.

In Hobbes's view, men are human objects in motion and can be studied as such; driven toward what they desire and away from what they fear, they establish monarchs amongst them to protect themselves from one another. Hobbes's controversial treatise helped to "naturalize" the civic realm and ready it for scientific treatment.

...

Hobbes holds that society is part of the natural world. Newton and Galileo showed that we can comprehend causal laws that govern the physical universe--why not, therefore, the smaller world of human society?

Hobbes takes an approach similar to Galileo's "compositive-resolutive" approach in physics--breaking down a complex phenomenon into parts and building it up again through systematic observation.

Leviathan begins with an examination of the senses, the means by which we know the external world; then imagination, which reaches possibilities beyond immediate experience; then the train of associations that lead thought in new and different directions.

The natural tendency of imagination is toward discovery and invention, this distinguishing man from other animals.

Society is a fit subject for scientific study, but first, the absurdities must be identified and eliminated. Hobbes gives central importance to speech. Although speech confers power and aids memory, it also lends itself to abuses.
<ol>
 	<li>We reason with terms that have no settled meaning. Something about the way in which we represent problems to ourselves in words makes them soluble or not, clear or obscure.</li>
 	<li>We fail to distinguish between real bodies and spirituous, immaterial things; we speak of "infusing faith" into somebody, thus signaling profound ignorance of what can do the infusing and be infused.</li>
 	<li>We remain tied to that old Platonic mistake, according to which "universals" are granted real existence. Only particular things have existence.</li>
 	<li>We treat metaphors as if they wereÂ real, and we complacently adopt terms for which there are no real-world referents. The Scholastics are to blame for this.</li>
</ol>
Reality is physical reality, material reality. If we are to have a scientific understanding of man, then man must be accepted as a material entity.

Society, composed of such entities, is then understood as a complex system made up of (human) matter in motion.
<ol>
 	<li>Motion is either involuntary and reflexive ("vital") or intentional.</li>
 	<li>Our motives and desires prompt intentional movements; we move toward what we want and away from what we fear or dislike. The root motives are grounded in pleasure versus pain.</li>
 	<li>The most fundamental desire is that of survival.</li>
 	<li>All our moral and ethical standards inherited from philosophy and religion are actually grounded in considerations of personal survival. Good and evil are not devoid of meaning, but they mean simply "pleasure" and "pain."</li>
</ol>
It is fear of a violent death that moves us to enter civil society.
<ol>
 	<li>Men gather in groups to prevent their destruction by other men.</li>
 	<li>Within society, members differ in ability but are sufficiently equal that no one of them could singly resist the power exerted by a combination of them.</li>
 	<li>Therefore, they invest a protector with such power as is necessary to protect each of them from the others in the same group. This monarchical power is the "leviathan"--the state.</li>
 	<li>We give up enough of our power to the monarch that he will have sufficient options to protect us. But our allegiance to the leviathan--and, hence, the monarch's power--lasts only as long as he is able to protect us, our interests, and our lives.</li>
</ol>
Hobbes's entire thesis is based on a hedonistic psychology, and Hobbes is not al all sheepish about stating as much.

In a nutshell, the sovereign has the power of reward and punishment. It is by that power that we move--away from punishment and toward reward. What passes for altruism or Christian charity is itself an expression of self-regard and self-preservation, based either on a desire for honor or eternal reward or on a fear of reprisal.

Concord in the state is equivalent of health in the body. Sedition is sickness. Ultimately, sedition leads to civil war, and civil war is death--it kills civic life. These are not metaphors but exact correspondences.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now these quite complex features are not themselves elementary sensations. So how do they come together? How does all of these going on finally constitute the experience of a lector?

Locke takes up the question in several places, but most directly in book II, ch.Â 33Â of the essay, the chapter he titles "Of the Association of Ideas". Now here he cites any number of ways thinking is let astray by custom and habit, and argues that it is important for children to be watched closely lest they begin to form the wrong sorts of association. A fair bit of hisÂ discussion considers forms of madness as best explained in terms of radically faulty associations. This is Locke the doctor speaking now.

In general, Locke explains the process as the result of regularly associated experiences and what might be called their reasonable connections. The elementary sensations are joint together much as the corpuscular elements of the physical world are held together by gravity to form more complex structures. The elementary sensations comprise something of a Newtonian mental realm.

		<title>Hume and the Pursuit of Happiness</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An empiricist, Hume was influenced by Bacon, Berkeley, and Locke. Developing Locke's program, Hume argues that the mind is formed out of sensory experience, that this is where everything begins. The external world impresses itself on the organs of sense.

By the revival of earlier perceptions, the mind is capable of the act of reflection.

But while the external physical world is capable of exciting the senses, the contents of the mind are just copies of what is occurring at the level of sensation.

This yields a theory of knowledge as always mediated. We never have an immediate knowledge of the external world, only the mediated knowledge that comes by way of this intermediary--the perceptual or sensory capabilities of a creature of the sort we are.

A century before Charles Darwin, Hume offers a quasi-Darwinian worldview, proposing that the creatures of nature survive by having the kind of constitution that renders survival more likely.

Hume is famous for raising questions about the concept of causation and how we arrive at the concept of causation.

He is known for developing core principles of association to account for how the mind comes to work on the evidence gleaned by the senses.
<ol>
 	<li>All other things being equal, A becomes associated with B when A and B have been present frequently in experience.</li>
 	<li>Repetition becomes one of the principles. All other things being equal, when A and B occur together frequently, A and B become more strongly associated.</li>
</ol>
Causation, then is simply what the mind assigns to constantly conjoined experiences.

Hume also writes, however, that the concept of causation is not a recording of something observed in the external world. Rather, it's a habitual mental process; the determinants of the concept of causality are inherent in our mental operations themselves.

The categories of moral right and wrong, likewise, are reflections of human dispositions and sentiments. Certain characteristics we have in our very biological constitutions, along with experience, determine what we will come to call right and wrong.
<ol>
 	<li>Hume does not so much relativize morality as he psychologizes it.</li>
 	<li>Morality, then, should be looked at as social constructions designed by creatures of a certain kind who are trying to maximize something as best they can. Hume has a word for what they are trying to maximize--utility.</li>
 	<li>Although Hume would reject all forms of moral realism, he is not skeptical about morality. Rather, he seeks to show how our constitutive nature brings about moral judgments.</li>
</ol>
Hume has tied the concept of causation to certain habitual modes of thought. He contends that passion must rule reason. The reasoning for this is Darwinian: Our survival depends on our ability to avoid pain and seek pleasure. Reason becomes the deliberative means of securing what the appetites and passions of life require.

We are all children of Hume. We understand that functions of government are to be understood in chiefly utilitarian terms. We understand that the wolrd as we know it is the creation of our own mental machinery.

A further concept of Hume's is the problem of induction, which states that the future is under no obligation to mimic the past. Any inference we might make about what will happen in the future based on past experience has no rational warrants.

		<title>Thomas Reid and the Scottish School</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By common sense, Reid always referred to what was universally and pragmatically represented in nature, including human nature, as part of the "constitution" of the being in question, whether caterpillar or man.

The principle of common sense, for Reid, does not mean the wisdom of the crowd. It doesn't mean the prevailing opinions, the settled ethos of a given community.

Rather, it is that which we are under an obligation to accept in all of the ordinary affairs of life. Reid illustrates the point with the "lowly caterpillar" that will crawl across Â a thousand leaves until it finds the one that's right for its diet.

At the core of Hume's epistemology is the theory that all our knowledge is mediated. Hume, thus, continues a long, almost uninterrupted philosophical tradition that says the eternal world comes to be represented in some way via mediation by the senses, a view with which Reid disagrees.

These philosophers conclude that, because all our knowledge is filtered through our senses, we can never know the real world except by way of these representations.

What results are "ideas" about the external world, but there is no way of determining the adequacy of such ideas as actual records or copies of the world.

If this were so, then skepticism is entirely appropriate.

Reid rejects this so-called "copy theory." More to the point, however, his analysis of the problem in this manner is intended to convey an experimental approach of the Baconian-Newtonian variety.

There is no evidence to support the view that the "impressions" made on the sense organs are what Â the mind becomes aware of. Not even philosophers are aware of their sensory impressions.

There is, therefore, no evidence that the ideas or knowledge we have should be thought of as some sort of "copy" of these impressions.

Reid's experiments demonstrate to him that the image of a right triangle projected on the spherical retina of the eye is itself curved; what we see, however, is not a curved triangle but the triangle as it is actually configured. We see what is there!

In fact, what happens is that physiological activity presents to the mind a system of natural signs; by a means Reid confesses he does not understand, the mind can decode these signs and move from the sign to the thing signified. There is a fit between our biology and the external world such that we are able to live in it.

The Humean conception of causation is at the very core of Hume's skepticism. It is flawed in the same way, according to Reid.

Constant conjunction of two things cannot be the grounding of our belief that one causes the other.
<ol>
 	<li>No two things are more constantly in temporal conjunction than day and night, yet no one thinks, "Day is the cause of night."</li>
 	<li>From constant conjunction alone, the concept of a "cause" would never arise.</li>
</ol>
The actual source of this concept is our own active powers. We know from infancy that we are able to bring things about; from this, we are led to the inference that events external to us are similarly produced by other powers.

In the same way, the ethical theory according to which morality is an essentially passion- or emotion-based set of self-interested actions is not the result of systematic inquiry and is defeated by such an inquiry.

Even the hedonist must calculate long-range consequences. Immediate sensations of pleasure and pain cannot account for our ability to swallow a nasty medicine for eventual benefit. Rationality is necessary presupposition even on the Humean account.

Philosophical principles ought to be able to account for evidence gathered in the real world. The long human record of altruism is not adequately explained by the Humean theory of it.

There must, in fact, be first principles of morals within us guiding our daily behavior, just as the caterpillar is guided to find the right leaf among thousands.

Hume on personal identity argues that the continuity of identity is based on the same principles that preserve the continuity of a parade formation of soldiers: As one or another marcher drops out, another takes his place, so that the "bundle of perceptions" is held together.

This is based on Hume's theory of causation as "constant conjunction." Because Reid considers this theory to be flawed, he does not believe it will work here either.
<ol>
 	<li>Hume says, "When I observe myself, I see nothing but a bundle of perceptions." And who, then is doing the observing?</li>
 	<li>For there to be treason, there must be a traitor; for there to be a "bundle of perceptions," there must be a percipient.</li>
</ol>
Reid saw Locke's theory (upon which Hume's was based) as hopeless from the outset: Remembering the loss of the Battle of Waterloo does not make one Napoleon!
<ol>
 	<li>A man remembers himself to have once been a boy and knows that he is today a brave young officer; an aged general remembers that he was once a brace young officer but no longer remembers he was a boy.</li>
 	<li>Thus, A = B and B = C, but A does not equal C!</li>
</ol>
Against the "idea" theory and its resulting skepticism, Reid offered a naturalistic, "common sense" alternative, according to which the creatures of nature, including human beings, are fitted out with whatÂ is needed for survival, for shared actions, and for valid knowledge of the external world. He insisted that Hume and Locke before him were not always faithful to the observational methods of Bacon and Newton, nor to their means of testing competing accounts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[France in the 18th century was the nation of Voltaire, La Mettrie, Rousseau, Helvetius, Condorcet, D'Alembert, and Diderot, thinkers who appealed directly to the ordinary citizen and encouraged a widespread skepticism toward traditional forms of authority. These were the leaders of the French Enlightenment. They changed the world and supplied it with an idiom that still dominates political and social thought. If their collective effort was not a deep and enduring contribution to philosophy, it must rank as one of the greatest attempts to translate philosophy into social and political action. It is in their collective effect that the wider world would attach itself to scientific modes of analysis and scientific programs of reform. By providing ordinary citizens with encyclopedic accounts of the principles and discoveries of science, they aimed to defeat superstition and the tyranny of the lettered classes over the untutored. In the process, they did much to weaken the authority of religious teaching, including its moral lessons, and much to weaken the political authority that rested on this teaching.

What we take to be the modern worldview is less a contribution of the Renaissance than of the age of science that followed in the 17th century. But consider this pair of quotations:

"My works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is the one true mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to know the true from the false" (Leonardo da Vinci [1452-1519]).

"Let us console ourselves for not knowing the possible connections between a spider and the rings of Saturn, and continue to examine what is within our reach" (Voltaire [1694-1778]).

Leonardo and Voltaire have much in common, though much, of course, divides them. Both are satisfied that the light of experience casts sufficient illumination for us to understand the nature of our difficulties. As vindication of his belief in experience, Voltaire had what Leonardo did not have: the inspiration and achievement of Newton.

We do not generally think of the witty and discerning minds of the Paris salons as "philosophers." Few, if any, philosophy journal articles are written now on the musings of Diderot, Holbach, Helvetius, Condorcet, Voltaire, La Mettrie, and others of their ilk.

The so-called salon philosophes invited the intelligent parts of the world into the long debate. The did not reserve philosophy to the philosophers. They opened up, into the public discourse, issue that long had existed primarily at the level at abstract philosophy.

But sometimes, the wit and wisdom of the philosophes is in danger of losing the refinement of philosophy and dropping to the level of rank propaganda.

However, the philosophes weren't actually out to prosecute the agenda of academic philosophy. They were out to change the world.
<ol>
 	<li>To change the wolrd is to change minds. The only alternative is tyrannical oppression.</li>
 	<li>This aspect of the Enlightment project is most apparent in the publication of Diderot's Encyclopedia, which focused on the authority of experience, absent any dogmatic teaching or religious overtones.</li>
 	<li>The outline of the massive project was given in the form of a "Tree of Human Knowledge," developed by Diderot and d'Alembert, that includes everything from working with slate to our knowledge of God.</li>
</ol>
Voltaire (1694-1778) was a powerful influence on what became this Age of Enlightment.

As with Descartes, he had been educated by the Jesuits.

At 23, he is found serving nearly a year in the Bastille for derisive criticism of the government. This event was a harbinger, for within a decade, Voltaire was exiled to England for offending the chevalier de Rohan.
<ol>
 	<li>Voltaire's reverential attitude toward Newton is part of his general judgement that British philosophy has triumphed over Cartesianism.</li>
 	<li>His <em>Letters on the English</em> makes this clear and ties the achievements in Britain to the intellectually liberated climate of thought: He compares membership in the Royal Society (science and achievement) to the French Academy (birth and orthodoxy).</li>
</ol>
Voltaire has a splendid model for this mode of casual criticism--Michel de Montaigne, whose famous <em>Essais</em> (1575) celebrates secular knowledge, common sense, common decency, the right way to work through problems, the philosophies worth having, and the gentle ridicule of the pomposity of self-appointed authority.

With Montaigne, too, there is an enlargement of the discursive community, a movement toward the democratization of knowledge.

Voltaire is in the direct patrimony of Montaigne: Knowledge is not meant to vindicate belief but to help us determine which beliefs are worth having.

The wit and iconoclasm, the attention to precision and machines duly noted, it is time to turn to a mind of a radically different cast, that of Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778).

Against the attention to science and technology, Rousseau looks to nature in the raw, unanalyzed, spared the "resolutive-compositive" methods of the tinkering classes.

Against the rationalism of the Enlightenment--its contempt for superstition and its reverence for high civilization--Rousseau draws attention to the inauthentic lives constrained and corrupted by civilization.

Rousseau is the harbinger of the <em>Romantic rebellion</em> but bears the same tools of high culture and literary astuteness that are the mark of Enlightenment thought.

In <em>Emile</em>, Rousseau takes the position that civilization works to the disadvantage of what is most authentic about us, that the very process of civilizing someone strips him of certain natural tendencies and sentiments.

In<em> Du Contrat Social</em> (1762), Rousseau offers one of the most summoning lines in all of political philosophy: "Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains."
<ol>
 	<li>Rousseau refered to the chained mind--the mind tied to orthodoxies that render it incapable of its own natural functions.</li>
 	<li>We find in Rousseau, too, a particular form of naturalism, a concession to nature as the last word, a skepticism toward merely human contrivances and merely habitual modes of conduct.</li>
</ol>
In La Mettrie (1709-1751), naturalism tends toward materialism. Man--A Machine, La Mettrie's bannded book of 1748, extends to its logical conclusion the materialistic drift of Descartes's own psychology.

The human body is a machine that winds its own springs. It is the living image of perpetual movement.

Given that all the faculties of the soul depend on the actions of the body, the soul is an "enlightened machine."

La Mettrie calls on the reader to come to grips with the fact that human life is biologically organized and that this organization is shaped by external conditions.

Locke's translator in France, Etienne Condillac (1715-1780), introduces in his 1754 <em>Treatise of Sensation</em> the model of the <em>sentient statue</em>, a block of stone, shaped by its environment.

As the result of an incessant interaction with a stimulating environment, the statue comes to form elementary Lockean sensations, ideas, and more complext ideas.

The point, of course, is that our essence does not precede our actual existence in the world and that the kinds of beings we are serve as a record of the experiences we've had.

Not long after this, Thomas Paine, in his <em>Common Sense</em>, will speak of rank and titles as "a magician's wand, which circumscribes human felicity." Again, the guide in all things is nature. Newton and Bacon instructed us in how to read the book of nature without adding our own preconceptions to the facts.

Helvetius is in the same tradition of a radical environmentalist.

But Helvetius recognizes that the classes that exists in this world must have been made, because it is obvious that political forces are needed to preserve them.

Given that so much energy is needed to keep this sort of social organization in place, there must be something horrifically unnatural about it. If that much work has to be done to preserve it, it must be because it opposes natural forces.

Condorcet (1743-1794), at the endÂ of the century, offers the promise of progress. To my mind, he represents what is most defining in this age of Enlightenment.

Condorcet reflects the dominant idea of his age and does so with special brightness and poignancy. It is the idea of progress.
<ol>
 	<li>In its Enlightenment form, it is more analytical and scientific, more political and self-conscious than the earlier Renaissance version.</li>
 	<li>Whereas the classical worldview conceives of a cosmos organized by principles of harmony and proportion, the notion of progress says that what is stationary is stagnant and the future is under no obligation to mimic the past.</li>
 	<li>Condorcet's <em>Sketch for an Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind</em>Â defends the plan to liberate the human imagination and, in the process, achieve something new, untried in world history.</li>
 	<li>He concludes--in the shadow of his own impending death--with the hope that a grand association of the scientifically enlightened, drawn from diverse nations, "would meet no obstacles; and it would assure among all the sciences and all the arts directed by their principles.. an equilibrium of knowledge, industry, and reason necessary for the progress and the happiness of human race."</li>
</ol>
The Enlightenment is, at once, a critique of traditionalism and a forward-looking movement of thought and action impelled by the methods and perspective of science. France would host some of the movement's most persuasive writers and thinkers, including Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, and Condorcet. Their revolution in thought was to be matched by political and social revolutions based on the recovery of natural rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pointers:
<ol>
 	<li>Know when not to speak.</li>
 	<li>Mind the rudeness of laconic response.</li>
 	<li>Don't be a self-righteous contrarian.</li>
</ol>
Bores:
<ol>
 	<li>The loud talker, who "silences the whole party by his sole power of lungs".</li>
 	<li>The excessive life-sharer, whom you no doubt know from your Facebook timeline.</li>
 	<li>The clever bore "takes up every idle speech, to show his wisdom at a cheap rate".</li>
 	<li>The indifferent or apathetic bore parades his inattentiveness in your face.</li>
 	<li>The lingering bore who overstays his welcome.</li>
 	<li>The hobby-riders, who sound like a broken record.</li>
 	<li>The Malaprops, with their special gift for choosing the least appropriate topics of conversation.</li>
 	<li>The egotistical bore, who stifles with his vanity.</li>
</ol>
Do's and don'ts:
<ol>
 	<li>Don't correct your conversation partner or go on righteousness crusades. It is a sign of, at best, vanity or, at worst, sheer rudeness to force your opinion on another.</li>
 	<li>Be selective. Novelist William Gibson stressed the importance of a "personal micro-culture". Susan Sontag wrote in her diary that she's only interested in people engaged in a project of self-transformation. Artist Austin Kleon has astutely argued that "you are a mashup of what you let into your life."</li>
 	<li>Keep your commitments but give those who fail to keep theirs the benefits of doubt.</li>
 	<li>Be mindful of your audience and don't parade your knowledge before those less learned.</li>
 	<li>Omission isn't lying, it's politeness. Learn to evade.</li>
 	<li>Say "yes" whenever possible. When you say "no", do so firmly.</li>
 	<li>Let your opinion change -- advice particularly apt in today's hasty culture where not having an opinion is considered an embarrassment; seek to understand rather than to be right, and don't be a know-it-all.</li>
 	<li>Don't be pretentious and do away with affectation.</li>
 	<li>Practice genuine humility and avoid arrogance.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Did we get a republic? What is a republic?

Madison says that a political regime is a republic only when the government's power is derived entirely from the people and "administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, from a limited period, or during good behavior."
<ol>
 	<li>Nothing in this is new or controversial. But Madison observes that history shows the closer something comes to that sense of a republic, the sooner it dies.</li>
 	<li>The republics that seem to make it are what he refers to as a kind of puritanical republic.</li>
</ol>
John Adams was behind that view of republics. He said that only "pure religion or austere morals" will be capable of holding a republican form of government together.

With these concerns at the forefront, Madison distinguishes between pure democracies, subject to the factionalism that leads to anarchy, and the right sort of republic, in which power is delegated by the people.

The nearly paralyzing tension, of course, arises from the need for a central government that is able to secure the finances and defense of the nation and the jealously guarded freedoms of the individual states.

The Bill of Rights. Was it necessary?

A remarkable feature of the Convention of 1787, which drafted the Constitution, is that it specifically refused to incorporate a Bill of Rights. The omission was a deliberate act based on vitally important understandings.

A self-governing people should decide what its own rights are--to list them is to limit them.

The federal government should not trump the communities that compose the federation: The people of Maryland or New York have formed self-governing communities based on their own views of theirs rights.

You have no need of federal guarantees of your rights against your local community: Its laws and principles are your own, and you need no defense against it.

The lesson taught by Montesquieu was that there are at base only three types of government:

A despotism rules by will, and in it, the people must cultivate reverential fear.

A monarchy, with rule by law in the hands of a single person, calls for the cultivation of honor.

A republic depends on the cultivation of virtue. Power must be separated lest its concentration convert the republic into a tyranny.
<ol>
 	<li>We find this in the Stoic outlook of Washington and many of the other founders--the recognition that the republic will succeed, because we have the resources to create and preserve lives of virtue and self-sacrifice.</li>
 	<li>Power in this new republic (as the founders of the American Republic believed) would come to be taken by a natural aristocracy that would arise when the free exercise of virtue is permitted and encouraged.</li>
</ol>
The Federalist Papers and the grand experiment in self-government mark a special chapter in human history, a chapter in which there would be a convergence of political, scientific, and moral energies capable of overturning the old order by which most of life was shaped. But the signal feature of the enterprise was the direct, open, respectful address to the people, an attempt to gain support by appealing to the common sense and mature political understanding of those who, in virtue of being fit for the rule of law, are fit to rule themselves.

		<title>Kant on Freedom</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=1366</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Immanuel Kant (1724--1804) devoted most of his adult life to the three following questions: "What can I know, what ought I to do, what can I hope?"

In one of his more accessible essays--"What is enlightenment?"--he asked and answered a different question.
<ol>
 	<li>His answer was that enlightenment was synonymous with intellectual freedom, with expressing one's own authentic ideas, not echoing the thoughts of others.</li>
 	<li>"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity... For enlightenment of this kind, all that is needed is freedom. And the freedom in question is the most innocuous form of all: freedom to make public use of one's reason in all matters."</li>
</ol>
Kant is, at once, the culmination of Enlightenment thought and the author of a philosophy that would set worrisome limits on the entire Enlightenment project.

Kant's <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> credits Hume with awakening the author from his "dogmatic slumber."
<ol>
 	<li>Hume argued convincingly that everything we know is the product of experience. The concept of causation should be understood chiefly as a kind of habitual mode of mental operation. Morality is the domain of passions and sentiments, grounded in considerations of self-interest and utility.</li>
 	<li>Kant can also be shown to have been influenced by Reid's concept of common sense.</li>
</ol>
Kant's Critique (not a broadside or polemic against reason but an inquiry into it, into what can be known using our rational resources and what cannot) takes up these challenges.

In his "first critique" (the second is the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em> and the third, his <em>Critique of Judgment</em>), Kant agrees with Hume in insisting that all of our knowledge arises from experience. However, he makes a fundamental distinction, saying it is a mistake to assume that because our knowledge arises from experience, that it is <em>grounded</em> in experience.

According to Hume's theory of causal concepts, we come to regard A as the cause of B, when A and B have been constantly conjoined in experience. This is not the conclusion of an argument but merely a habit of the mind.

In Kant's terminology, cognitive or epistemic holdings that are not the result of experience are referred to as "pure."
<ol>
 	<li><em>Pure</em> in Kant's sense refers to what is non-empirical.</li>
 	<li>A <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> means a critical examination of the forms of rationality that could not come from experience but make up the framework within which experience is possible.</li>
 	<li>There cannot be experience except by way of time and space. Thus, Kant reaches the concept of the pure (non-empirical) intuitions of time and space. Kant uses the word <em>intuitions</em> to mean a necessary precondition for something else to come about.</li>
 	<li>Logically, then, this precondition must be prior to all experience--Kant's famous terminology <em>a priori</em>--or there could be no experiences.</li>
</ol>
Kant argues that there is something fundamentally lacking in Hume's account of "knowledge" and experience. Again, all knowledge may be said to arise out of experience but may not be grounded in experience.

In his "Analytic of Concepts," Kant seeks to provide the framework for all knowledge. He contends that in all instances, knowledge involves a judgement, formed within a universal categorical framework that includes entities that could not possibly be gained by experience.

Kant presents four "Pure Categories of the Understanding" that could not be "given" in experience and that admit of no possible exceptions:
<ol>
 	<li>There are categories of <em>quantity</em>: unity, plurality, and totality.</li>
 	<li>There are categories of <em>quality</em>: reality, negation, and limitation.</li>
 	<li>There are categories of <em>modality</em>: possibility, existence, and necessity.</li>
 	<li>And there are categories of <em>relation</em>: inherence, causality, community, and correlation.</li>
</ol>
Certain categories may be given by experience, but nothing in experience "gives" totality or <em>necessity</em>, for example,
<ol>
 	<li>We can know unity, and we can know plurality, but nothing in experience allows us to know totality. Nonetheless, we know, without counting, that there is an infinite number of integers.</li>
 	<li>Likewise, nothing in the world of sensible matter can be known to be necessarily the case--anything could imaginably be different. Experience can only lead to inferences of greater or lesser probability.</li>
 	<li>But even those inferences are intelligible only within the framework of necessity: That is, something is "probable" to the extent that it is not necessary.</li>
</ol>
If, however, we are beings of a different sort, would the categories be different? Do they arise out of our natures? No, they are the necessary condition for knowledge of anything. As the pure intuitions are the necessary forms of experience, the pure categories are the necessary forms of knowledge.

Kant claims that Hume is wrong to say that no "synthetic" propositions can be known to be true <em>a priori</em>, only "analytic" ones. What is meant by these terms?

An <em>analytic</em>Â proposition is one in which subject-term and predicate-term are essentially synonymous: All bachelors are unmarried men. The truth of analytic propositions is known <em>a priori</em>, which is to say, prior to, and independently of, experience, for what is involved here are mere truths about words.

A <em>synthetic</em> proposition is a factual statement about items and events in the world: Bill is wearing shoes. In Hume's epistemology, no synthetic proposition can be known to be true except by way of experience, that is <em>a posterior</em>.

The Kantian rebuttal depends on the pure intuitions and pure categories.
<ol>
 	<li>Every experience we shall ever have is within the intuited framework of space and time.</li>
 	<li>All our knowledge claims will match with the categories of quantity, quality, and so on.</li>
 	<li>Thus, every empirical statement we make will have certain properties that can be establishedÂ <em>a priori</em>.</li>
 	<li>Therefore, we <em>can</em> make synthetic statements whose truth is known <em>a priori</em>; for instance, "Every experience will take place in space and time."</li>
</ol>
Forms of knowledge, like forms of experience, are not themselves given in experience but determine the ordering, organizing, and patterning of all possible knowledge.

Thus, in a manner of speaking, for Hume to be right, Kant has to be right. The Kantian <em>a priori</em> framework is required for Hume's account of causation and knowledge to work.

When Kant grants that Hume was right to conclude that all knowledge comes from experience, he is recording his own modest credentials as an empiricist. He is also stating his position to be in the province of the ideal theorist, as Reid used the term.

The world known and the world knowable is the world as processed by the organs and principles of perception.
<ol>
 	<li>What we know of the external world factually takes the form of <em>phenomena</em>. The question is: How accurately does our mental representation of reality reflect actual reality?</li>
 	<li>Kant makes a distinction between phenomena and the realm beyond experience, which he refers to as <em>noumena</em>--the thing as it really is. The phenomenon is the experience it creates in a percipient.</li>
 	<li>The knowable is confined to the categorical framework within which all elements of the understanding are located. Reason can step outside of this and, thus, has a certain reach superior to the understanding, but its reach is not limitless.</li>
 	<li>There is a lot of Hume in Kant and very little Kant in Hume. But in Kant, we begin to see what a rationalist critique of a systematic and relentless empiricism looks like--it looks a lot like Kant's first critique.</li>
</ol>

		<title>Moral Science and the Natural World</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hume had made a strong case for the proposition that the grounds on which we judge things to be good or bad is not some abstract external moral reality, but the manner in which the event in question affects us cellularly and physiologically.

Hume's moral theory arises from his epistemology. Once the problem of knowledge is "solved" in favor of impressions and ideas, moral issues can be collapsed into questions about impressions and ideas.
<ol>
 	<li>But "since morals, therefore, have an influence on the actions and affections, it follows that they cannot be derived from reason, and that because reason alone, as we have already proved, can never have any such influence."</li>
 	<li>"Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason."</li>
</ol>
The principal adversary to latter-day versions of utilitarianism is in the form of moral theories patterned after Kant's and referred to as <em>deontological</em> theories.
<ol>
 	<li>Central to any deontological moral theory is the idea that it takes the imperative of certain moral precepts to be unconditional (that is, a given action is right or wrong under all circumstances).</li>
 	<li>Deontological moral theories are explicitly opposed to utilitarian theories, to the idea that something is right because it achieves good or desirable outcomes.</li>
</ol>
Kant accepted an essentially scientific conception of human nature but rejected the proposition that the merely natural dimensions of human life exhaust the characteristics of our humanity.

However, in addition to being subject to the laws of nature, human beings are also <em>rational</em> beings. What that means is that in addition to occupying the natural realm, we occupy what Kant calls the <em>intelligible realm</em>.
<ol>
 	<li>In the intelligible realm, we account for events not by invoking physical causes but by examining reasons.</li>
 	<li>We understand the course of action taken in the intelligible realm by understanding the reasons that guide the action.</li>
</ol>
The other feature central to Kant's moral theory is autonomy of the will.
<ol>
 	<li>If our actions were entirely determined by our physical constitutions, they would simply be reactions.</li>
 	<li>Autonomy is the necessary condition for any moral ascriptions or judgments to apply to any actions.</li>
</ol>
Kant argues that we arrive at the concept of freedom via our intuitive awareness of moral law.
<ol>
 	<li>The means by which the concept is reached is rational, not empirical. There can be no "scientific" proof of freedom.</li>
 	<li>"Laws of freedom" sounds contradictory, but only because one thinks of laws in the scientific sense of strict determinism.</li>
 	<li>The morally autonomous person is one whose freedom is governed by laws he gives himself.</li>
</ol>
The reasons to act in one way or another are of two sorts: hypothetical imperatives and categorical imperatives.

If the choice of one alternative over another is made to attain a specific end, it is called a <em>hypothetical imperative</em>.
<ol>
 	<li>Hypothetical imperatives are tied to a particular context and to the needs and desires of natural creatures under the press of the need to survive, to avoid pain and gain pleasure.</li>
 	<li>Decisions thus grounded are non-moral, because they arise from our natures not as rational beings but merely as human beings: They are essentially reactions.</li>
</ol>
The <em>categorical imperative</em>, on the other hand, declares an action to be morally necessary in itself, without reference to any purpose.
<ol>
 	<li>Morality begins with a rational and autonomous being in the intelligible realm, where we are called on to have reasons for action.</li>
 	<li>We must find a rule or precept or principle that guides actions of a given kind and that is universal.</li>
</ol>
The categorical imperative is not tied to a particular desire or impulse or motive; rather, it asserts its own moral authority.

One of the characteristics of a moral precept is that it's universalizable, not tied to a particular condition and, hence, dependent on the contingent facts of the natural world.

Moral maxims, as reasons for acting, are applicable to all situations in which generically that given kind of action might take place.
<ol>
 	<li>The categorical imperative is not tied to a particular desire or impulse or motive; rather, it asserts its own moral authority.</li>
 	<li>The authority of the imperative is contained in the maxim itself, not something that it brings about, not some contingent outcome.</li>
</ol>
John Stuart Mill believed that Kant's categorical imperative was a license to perform absolutely hideous acts.
<ol>
 	<li>Kant's pure categories of the understanding do not supply content but the framework governing the possibility of understanding.</li>
 	<li>Kant advised that we "act in such a way that the maxim of your action would, if you were able, be instituted as a universal law of nature."</li>
 	<li>What troubled Mill was the prospect of, say, an arsonist invoking the categorical imperative and wishing to install as a universal law of nature the successful destruction of property by fire.</li>
</ol>
The fear can arise only from a misunderstanding of Kant's entire argument.
<ol>
 	<li>Any ignoble end or any end whatever tiedÂ to considerations of pleasure or keen desire or emotion comes under the heading of a hypothetical imperative, not a categorical imperative.</li>
 	<li>The imperative is a law the will gives to itself. There are sufficient resources within Kantian moral thought to rule out arson as a candidate universal law!</li>
</ol>
Kant offers another version of the categorical imperative: "Man is never merely a means to an end, but always an end unto himself."
<ol>
 	<li>To use another person as a means or a tool is to deny that person the very moral autonomy on which "right" and "wrong" becomes possible.</li>
 	<li>To do so would mean that you qualify for the same treatment. As Abraham Lincoln said, "As I would not be a slave, I would not be a master."</li>
 	<li>Kant is famous for concluding from this that one must never lie. If Smith lies to Jones to get Jones to do something that Jones would not do if properly informed, Smith trumps Jones' moral autonomy, thus violating the categorical imperative.</li>
</ol>
Kant's epitaph summarizes much about him: "The starry sky above him, the moral law within him." Kant gives us moral law, not as a means to seek pleasure or avoid pain, but as a way of doing the right thing and, thus, substantiating ourselves as moral beings.

		<title>The Idea of Freedom</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The late Enlightenment hosted a counterculture, centered in the little duchy of Weimar and featuring Goethe, Schiller, and other luminaries. Though the sources of the <em>Romantic rebellion</em> lay largely in the work of the rationalist empiricists of the previous 100 years, the German Romantics and their followers were convinced that the mechanistic philosophies developed in the wake of the Newtonian achievement were both incomplete and misleading. They returned to the book of nature, wherein they found mystery and transcendental powers, powers of an essentially aesthetic character grounded in freedom. In Goethe's <em>Faust</em> and in Schiller's <em>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</em>, freedom is offered as the very definition of our humanity.

Romanticism is one of the perennial achievements of the human imagination and, in its philosophically developed expression, one of the significant productions of the 19th century.

If Romanticisim is a reaction to and rejection of the Enlightenment, its origins are clearly traced to the Enlightenment itself.
<ol>
 	<li>The principle agenda of the Enlightenment is to challenge traditional authority through the tools and resources of a scientific worldview.</li>
 	<li>Thus, the Enlightenment sets itself up against what is taken to be artificial contrivances--the overly analytical Scholastic philosophies, the authority of Scripture or revelation, the invented powers of rank and title, and slothful acceptance of tradition and the alleged wisdom of bygone times.</li>
 	<li>If Descartes is one of the fathers of the modern worldview, let us recall that he helps to set the stage for the Enlightenment by rendering doubt the beginning of all knowledge.</li>
</ol>
With Rousseau, we get what might be regarded as the beginning of a veritable religion of nature. His writings show what was immanent in the ethos of the Enlightenment from the first: namely, a religion of nature that cannot be fully described with the artificial instrument of language.

Kant inserted this insuperable barrier between the world of phenomena and the noumenal reality behind that world.
<ol>
 	<li>Kant's philosophy at once entices us to get to the bottom of things, to see what's behind the screen, and to understand at the outset that the formalisms that guide and edit perception are of little avail.</li>
 	<li>But if perception in this rule-governed sense will not disclose the real nature of things, and if science is based primarily on observation, and if we know that observation reveals merely phenomenal, not noumenal, reality, then science has built-in limitations.</li>
 	<li>Kant's moral theory also places us as rational beings in that "intelligible real" outside the causal order of the natural sciences.</li>
</ol>
We now begin to hear deep resonances to the effect that what really defines us is our freedom, that freedom renders us unique in the entire cosmos, apart from all other things.

The so-called <em>Romantic rebellion</em> conveys the sense of the mystery behind the reality, which somehow is uncovered through the genius of art and literature. It's not accessible to the eye until the eye is liberated from the formalisms of science, logic, and philosophy itself.

Goethe (1749-1832) is one of the very souls of Romanticism. His <em>Farbenlehrer</em> (1810) is one of the most detailed analyses to that date of color vision! Goethe argues that the Newtonian theory of light explains everything except <em>what we see</em>!
<ol>
 	<li>There is nothing in the physics of light that tells us anything about how the world appears to us.</li>
 	<li>It tells us nothing about the perception of beauty.</li>
</ol>
Goethe's 10-year friendship with Friedrich Schiller was decisive in Goethe's writing of Faust. In Schiller's <em>Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man</em>, freedom creates and determinism limits and kills.
<ol>
 	<li>We are never our authentic selves so fully as when at play.</li>
 	<li>The idea is that the divinity within us expresses itself most fully when we do something for the sheer intrinsic worth of activity itself and not for anything external to it.</li>
 	<li>This is Schiller's sense of the authenticity of play, his aesthetic creed.</li>
</ol>
The Faust legend depicts the limits of science and the transcendental nature of freedom.

The Faust of Part 1 is the bored polymath who, knowing everything, finds nothing in knowledge that offers abiding pleasure. What it would take for Faust to pledge his soul is for Mephistopheles to create in him an experience of such a nature that he would never tire of it.
<ol>
 	<li>"What would you sell your soul for?" is the questions at the bottom of the play.</li>
 	<li>What is clear is that a scientific knowledge of the world does not make us at home in it.</li>
 	<li>Clear, too, are the lengths to which one goes in order to achieve the transcendent-- an experience of such quality and sublimity as to command time to stop in her tracks.</li>
 	<li>It is only our autonomy, our radical freedom, that allows us to enter into such "Faustian bargains"--the soul being bet on the possibility of total satisfaction.</li>
</ol>
The Faust of Part 2, created by Goethe years later, is one for whom the transcendentally joyous experience is the freedom of others: the spectacle of a free people, engaged in the art of life. The question in Part 2 is how this whole Faustian bargain is going to work out.
<ol>
 	<li>Complete freedom is the authenticity that comes from what we have freely chosen to do.</li>
 	<li>The German philosopher Johan Fichte, one of Kant's young contemporaries, asked: How do we know when we are free? He answers: when we meet opposition.</li>
 	<li>Having gone through the range of possibilities that only the devil can present, Faust has an utterly novel experience--the transcendent joy of having his lands given over to all the people who have toiled on them.</li>
 	<li>Romantic freedom is ultimately selfless, the absorption into a totality, freely giving up private freedom for the sake of others.</li>
 	<li>Thus, Faust is redeemed in the end of the story.</li>
</ol>
The idea of freedom, centered to Kant's moral philosophy and celebrated by Goethe, Schiller, and their kindred "Romantic idealists," is an informing chapter in the long debate.

What the aesthetes concluded was that science in the wake of Newton had become mechanical, reductive, indifferent to the human condition, and depreciating of the human condition when it does consider it.

What they would put in its place is the truth of nature against the fabrications of the natural philosopher, a generous recognition of the creative power of genius, and the transcendent sources of beauty and wonder. The attribute of wonder is central to our humanity in the Romantic view. Any philosopher who would explain the world mechanically has not seen the world.

		<title>The Hegelians and History</title>
		<link>http://blog.ziltex.com/?p=1392</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the middle of the 19th century to the present, the philosophy of Hegel (1770-1831) would have a profound influence, at times a nearly revolutionary influence. In Hegel, one finds the merging and creative synthesis of many of the strongest tendencies in Romantic thought. First is the idea of progressive and evolving reality--not the staid mechanical repetitiousness of mere causality, but an active principle at work in the natural world. Second, there is the criticism of science as not being up to the task of comprehending this world, tied as it is to reductive schemes.

The first step in the direction of understanding, then is the identification not of a <em>cause</em> but of a <em>reason</em>. Hegel has as the reason for the evolution of human mind and society a rather Gothic and terrifying "Absolute" that uses the conflicts of history to realize itself ever more fully. The modern state is seen as the culmination of this struggle.

Hegel shares with his immediate predecessors, and with Romanticism at large, the judgment that science, as traditionally understood as "perfected" in the age of Newton, is a narrow, one-sided, misleading affair.

If science stays at the level of mechanistic explanation and the particularization of the complex into some reduced non-reality, then it will be capable ofÂ explaining very little. Science will, in fact, become merely an exercise in the vindication of its own flawed methods.

The subject of truth itself is what has real being, in the sense of nothing being added or modified by peculiar or merely conventional modes of analysis.

Descartes's own revolution was never lost on Hegel. As understood by Hegel, Descartes's achievement was to recognize that knowledge in all its forms is but "the unity of thought and being."

Though he admires Newton, Hegel regards Newton's work as making it possible for Locke's philosophy to become nearly official. The commitment to perceptual modes of knowledge and shunning of deeper metaphysical considerations are products of this mode of thinking.
<ol>
 	<li>If the world is defined as merely the action of corpuscles, the laws governing corpuscles will be all that will be studied; everything else will be ignored.</li>
 	<li>And the discovered causal laws could, in fact, be entirely different without raising any surprise or concern. If instead of <em>F = ma</em>, the relationship had been <em>F = 5m + 3.2a</em>, it would be no occasion for debate.</li>
 	<li>Thus, the scientist gives us no complete comprehension of the natural world. Through these mere summaries of correlations and cause-effect sequences, he never arrives at what the rest of us call "reality."</li>
</ol>
Nothing in the Newtonian achievement explains just <em>why</em> the laws are as they are. Why is everything the way it is and not some different way instead?

To include Hegel within the tradition of Romanticism or German Romantic Idealism requires that we turn to Johann Fichte. Indeed, the famous "Hegelian" triad of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis is actually Fichte's contribution and was rarely employed by Hegel himself.
<ol>
 	<li>Fichte recognized a fundamental conflict in Kant's epistemology: If there is a conceptual or logical barrier between reality as it is and reality as it is perceived, philosophy must commit to either bypass mind in every possible way or to accept that it is mind that is the worthy object of attention.</li>
 	<li>Fichte argues that the ultimate reality is that of idea, the starting Â point of philosophy then being the transcendental ego.</li>
 	<li>According to Hegel, we ought to be looking not merely for those causal connections revealed in scientific laws but for the reason behind the laws, because reality is rational.</li>
</ol>
To understand an event is finally to identify the reason behind it, and reasons are not "causes" by another name.
<ol>
 	<li>Causes can be final or merely efficient, but they carry no sense of necessity with them; they are merely contingent facts of the world.</li>
 	<li>But knowing the reason for an event is to understand that the event had to take the form it did.</li>
</ol>
Hegel applies this to human history itself. There is a distinct evolutionary perspective in Romanticism. There must be a reason for human development: from basic survival to human communities to literacy and rationality, each stage higher than the previous one.

Romanticism perceives an evolutionary struggle--<em>Sturm und Drang</em>--that produces new and better things not predictable in a mechanistic view.

Human history is the result of something trying to work itself out or realize itself through this great evolutionary struggle. It is out of the struggle itself that something gets resolved. AndÂ it is in the resolution that we find life lived at a higherÂ plane. There is reason in human history.

Hegel gave several names to this something, most commonly "the Absolute" but also "soul" or "spirit"--<em>Geist</em>.

In Hegel's day, the Absolute expresses itself in the <em>state</em>, declared by Hegel to be "the march of God in the world"! So called "Hegelians of the right" would defend the claims of the state against any and every claim from the mere individuals who live in it.

Hegel finds that the state, as the ethical aspect of the Absolute, takes precedence over Kant's "good will" of the individual.

Kant claimed that good will was the only pure good in the universe: the will to bring about, if we could, that which we would bring about in our most rational moments.

For Hegel, this dependence of the will of the moral agent leaves room for arbitrary and even wicked conduct. The claims of conscience have a moral superiority over mere convention but cannot be substituted without peril for the commands of the just state.

Hegel prefers the formulations of the brilliant young philosopher Fichte: The greatest freedom of the will consists in surrendering freedom for the sake of the whole.

What really exists does so in virtue of an essentially dialectical process. Reality is the synthetic outcome of affirming and negating forces.

Fichte is important philosophically as the architect for the Hegelian ontological logic that features the famous dialectical triad of <em>thesis</em>, <em>antithesis</em>, and the <em>synthesis</em>--the progress through conflict reality arising from opposing tendencies.

Fichte's description of the dialectical realization of human freedom is an example:
<ol>
 	<li>Man is born free (thesis).</li>
 	<li>But he cannot know this until his freedom is first opposed and constrained by others (antithesis).</li>
 	<li>In the synthesis, or final stage, man passes the stage of freedom for its own sake and comes to know freedom as an instrumentality to be used for the good of all.</li>
</ol>
The dialectical ontology defended by Fichte enters Hegel's metaphysics at every point.

Romanticism brings the recognition that with the sublime comes a dialectic of terror and conflict and conflagration, the progress is won at a price, that history is organic. Nothing stays in place. And reality is always more than what we see.
